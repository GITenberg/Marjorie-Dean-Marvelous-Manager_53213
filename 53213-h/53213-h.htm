  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />ACROSS THE CAMPUS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“To go, or not to go?—that is the question,”
paraphrased Marjorie Dean glancing up from the
open letter in her hand. She fixed her eyes on
Jerry Macy, her room-mate as though trying to read
what was in her chum’s mind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whether ’tis nobler to eat Baretti’s turk,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And circulate upon the campus drear;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or to take luggage and be off for home</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To roost four days upon the family tree.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Jerry aptly supplied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fine, Jeremiah. I certainly would love to
roost on the Deans’ family tree for four blessed
days.” Marjorie’s voice rang with wistfulness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“I’ve tried to persuade myself into believing that
it won’t make much difference to the dormitory
girls if we decide we’d best go home for Thanksgiving.
But I’m not sure.” Marjorie knitted
troubled brows. “This is the tenth,” she reflected
aloud. “Whether we go home, or whether we stay
on the campus over Thanksgiving, we’ve enough to
do beforehand to keep us hustling.” She sprang up
from her chair as though animated anew by the
mere recollection of work yet to be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why remind me, beautiful Bean? I’m sadly
aware of the fact. What we must do is organize
the new Travelers’ sorority and let them see the
dormitory girls through Thanksgiving. If they do
nicely,” Jerry continued in patronizing tones, “their
reward’ll be more work, and lots of it. If they
flivver—but they won’t. We old Travelers knew
how to pick out our successors. We’re safe to go
home and leave our Thanksgiving stunts to our little
Traveler sisters to carry out. Ha; great intellect!”
Jerry admiringly patted one of her own plump
shoulders. “You always do suggest such brilliant
ideas, Jeremiah,” she gushed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How conceited you are! Still, there’s a grain
of wisdom in your vain remarks.” Marjorie patted
Jerry’s other shoulder. “I hereby confer upon you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the high and noble order of the pat,” she declared
in a deep pompous voice. She accompanied her
words with several pats, each one more forceful
than the last.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The hard and croo-il order of the whack, I’ll
say.” Jerry caught the conferring hand in time to
save herself one last thump. “Now that I’ve been
initiated into this wonderful order what happens
to me next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you in a minute. Let me think.” Marjorie
 fixed absent eyes on Jerry as she considered
the situation. “You’re to go downstairs and telephone
Kathie and Lillian to come over to dinner
at the Hall this evening. If they can’t come to dinner,
then they must come afterward. Tell them the
time has come to open the box. That will bring
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet it will,” Jerry made slangy concurrence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’ll depend on you to hunt Leila, Vera,
Ronny, Lucy and Muriel. They’re not to dare
think of another engagement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yessum.” Jerry made a respectful, bobbing bow
to Marjorie. “Please, mum, may I ask what you’ll
be doing, mum, about the same time I’m rushing
upstairs and down?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going over to Silverton Hall,” Marjorie returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>as she crossed the room to her dress closet
and reached for coat and fur cap. “I’ll see Robin,
Phil and Barbara; bring them back to dinner, if
I can. Thank fortune Barbara is at Silverton Hall
this year instead of Acasia House. I’ll be back by
five o’clock. It’s ten minutes to four now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you’ll have to go some,” Jerry said skeptically.
“If you are back here with those three girls
by six o’clock I’ll give you a prize. Remember,
you can’t stay to dinner at Silverton Hall. We’ve
Kathie and Lillian to consider.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The prize is as good as won. What are you
going to give me?” Marjorie’s inquiry was slyly
coaxing. She sidled confidently up to Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind now.” Jerry waved her away.
“Come back at five o’clock and ask me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will. I’m going z-i-p-p across the campus.
Just like that!” Marjorie made a lightning forward
pass with one arm. “I’m going to have a
wind sail. There’s a dandy stiff wind blowing today.
Mary Raymond and I used to take our school
umbrellas when we were little girls and go out on
a windy day with them. It was a regular game.
We named it ‘wind sails.’ We’d let the wind blow
us along. Sometimes the umbrellas would turn inside
out, or the wind would whisk them away from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>us and we’d have to chase them a long way. Once
mine blew into the river, and once a big boy caught
Mary’s umbrella and ran off with it. We never
saw either of those bumbershoots again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie paused at the door to laugh at the recollection
of childhood adventures. “Oh, Jerry,” she
changed the subject with sudden abruptness, “we’ll
have to dig up some eats for a spread. Whoever
dreamed of gathering in the Travelers without feeding them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll ask Leila to run us into town for eats as
soon as you come back. That’s an incentive to
hurry,” bribed Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are times when I can’t help appreciating
you, Jeremiah. Good-bye. I’m in <i>such</i> a hurry.”
Marjorie breezily closed the door and made a
speedy descent of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>She opened the massive front door of the Hall
with the same gusty energy, and went down the
front steps at a frisky jump. The brisk November
wind caught her none too gently, blew a fluff of
curls about her sparkling face and a brighter color
into her rosy cheeks. She paused for an instant on
the drive to inhale deeply the crisp, invigorating
November air, then she set off across the campus
at her best hiking stride.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>With the wind at her back, noisily urging her
along, she laughed enjoyingly, spread her arms wide
in lieu of sails and ran with it. Passing a little
delegation of lingering robins, strung along a tree
limb, their feathers fluffed out, their red breasts
making a bit of autumn color against the brown
limb, she whistled cheerily to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naughty little fellows,” she playfully chided.
“You should have started for the land of flowers
long before now. You’ll have to hurry if you expect
to get there in time to eat Thanksgiving dinner with
your folks. I ought to take that advice to myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bump! Her eyes still lingering on the flock of
birds, she collided forcefully with a girl who had
deliberately courted collision. Muriel Harding,
emerging from the library, had spied Marjorie from
the library steps. Her mischievous love of teasing
always uppermost, she had approached Marjorie
unseen, bent on surprising her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uh-h-h!” Muriel pretended to stagger back.
“Why don’t you look where you’re going, lady?”
she demanded gruffly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you?” The two girls faced each
other, flushed and laughing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did. I decided to let you know I was near
you,” confessed Muriel. “If you had been moderately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>observing you might have averted the crash.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I doubt it.” Marjorie looked her skepticism.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So do I,” Muriel agreed so amiably that the
pair again broke into laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’d best come with me,” Marjorie invited.
“Jerry’s hunting for you, but that’ll be all right.
I’ve found you.” She went on to explain her errand
to Silverton Hall. “Forward, march,” she
concluded, taking hold of Muriel’s right arm. “Step
lively. I’ve lost at least three precious minutes exchanging
mostly impolite remarks with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll hit up a pace,” Muriel slangily assured.
“I’m nothing if not obliging. It’s fortunate for
you that you met me. I am always <i>so</i> helpful.”
Her brown eyes danced roguishly. “You must
<i>know</i> that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve heard you say so.” Marjorie was purposely
vague. “If I had been even moderately observing
I might have noticed that you were. That is,
if you really——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why dwell on the subject? This is the way the
wild wind goes.” She began whisking Marjorie
over the half frozen ground at a mad run. Marjorie
sturdily kept up with her. The two girls tore
across the campus toward their goal, shrieking with
laughter, bubbling over with high spirits.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>They were nearing Craig Hall, one of the campus
houses which they had to pass on their diagonal
route to Silverton Hall, when the front door
of the house opened and two young women came
out on the veranda, then descended the steps. Evidently
their ears caught the sounds of mirth emanating
from the pair of exuberant P. G.’s. Two
pairs of eyes, one pair coldly green, the other small,
black and shrewd, immediately fastened on Marjorie
and Muriel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look who’s here. Keep right on going,” Muriel
muttered in Marjorie’s ear. She nodded to one
of the two girls who had come from Craig Hall and
were now within a few feet of her and Marjorie.
Her nod was courteous rather than friendly. The
response she received was a stiff inclination from
Doris Monroe’s golden head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had obeyed Muriel’s muttered direction.
For the barest instant her clear, truthful gaze met,
impersonally, the narrowing, hostile eyes of Leslie
Cairns. She then glanced serenely away from Leslie.
She had long since ceased to regard Leslie
Cairns with personal displeasure. This in spite of
the ex-student’s treacherous attempt to frustrate
her and Robin Page’s plans in the matter of the
buying of the dormitory site.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>As for Doris Monroe, Marjorie had been rebuffed
by chilling looks on three different occasions when
she had encountered and spoken to the haughty
sophomore. She now claimed the privilege of one
repeatedly ignored, to ignore in return. She had
not given up the idea of carrying out a certain
gracious little plan she had in mind to further the
popularity of her beautiful “fairy-tale princess.”
Marjorie was too great of spirit to harbor resentment
against Doris Monroe, simply because Doris
did not like her. Instead she found herself experiencing
the anxiety of one who had suddenly encountered
a friend in a dangerous position.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A DISQUIETING REMINDER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Br-r-r!” Muriel made a pretense of shivering.
“Did you notice how the Ice Queen scorned us?
And what a noted person she had with her?” She
waited until they had put a few yards between
themselves and the other pair of girls before sarcastically
launching the inquiries.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I saw,” Marjorie returned composedly.
“I’m sorry. I knew Leslie Cairns was living in the
town of Hamilton. This is the first time I have seen
her since last summer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the first time I’ve seen her since before she
left college,” Muriel replied. “She’s homelier than
ever, but that cheviot sports suit and hat she has on
are dreams. What a splendid combination—the
Hob-goblin and the Ice Queen!” Muriel’s private
pet name for Leslie Cairns had always been the
“Hob-goblin.” “Sounds like the title of a fairy
tale, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly.” Marjorie nodded abstractedly. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>had forgotten Muriel’s uncomplimentary name for
Leslie. With the return of it to memory came her
own imaginative fancy regarding Doris Monroe.
Yes, Doris was truly like an enchanted princess.
Now Leslie Cairns had suddenly appeared, bearing
fanciful resemblance to a wicked wizard. Marjorie
smiled to herself at her own absurdity of thought.
Still it made a certain impression on her which time
did not obliterate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you thinking about, Marvelous Manager?”
Muriel gave her chum’s arm an emphatic
tug. The two had kept up their swinging stride and
were now nearing Silverton Hall. “Come down out
of the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wasn’t up in them,” Marjorie smilingly denied.
“I was thinking about Miss Monroe, and——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the fatal results of cultivating Leslie
Cairns,” interrupted Muriel mockingly. “Don’t
worry, Marjorie. Trust the icy Ice Queen to look
out for her own interests. Greek has met Greek.
I’ve roomed long enough with the Ice Queen to
know that she always pleases herself first. This being
Leslie Cairns’ motto, we may presently expect
to find them on the outs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so.” Marjorie was not sanguine. “I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>learned by experience, Muriel, not to under-rate
Leslie Cairns’ capacity for making trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I know she’s a star trouble maker, even if
she has never succeeded in anything she tried to
do to injure us,” Muriel readily admitted. “But
you stood so staunchly for the right, Marjorie Dean,
in all the fusses we had with her and the rest of
the Sans, things simply had to turn out O. K. at
the last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t stand out more strongly for the right
than any of the other Travelers,” Marjorie hastily
corrected, her reply bordering on vexation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, you did, Modest Manager,” Muriel
cheerfully contradicted. “I have all the proofs of
the case at my tongue’s end.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep them there,” Marjorie told her with
feigned displeasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, very well.” Muriel was all amiability. “I
may think of some other sweet little thing about you
later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Readers of the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean High School
Series</span>,” which comprises four volumes, and the
“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean College Series</span>,” also in four
volumes, are thoroughly at home with Marjorie
Dean and her many friends. “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean,
College Post Graduate</span>,” forms the initial volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>in the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean Post Graduate Series</span>.”
Returned to Hamilton College as a post graduate
Marjorie took up the work she had set her heart
upon doing. Surrounded by a devoted circle of
girls who had kept pace with her in college, Marjorie
felt that her most momentous year of enterprise and
accomplishment had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lack of unity at Wayland Hall had distressed
her not a little since her return to the campus. She
had dreamed rosy dreams of a unified Hamilton
which she had fondly hoped might come true that
very year. Instead, Wayland Hall, the house she
loved best of all the campus houses, and her own
roof tree, was brimming with dissention. She was
now reflecting rather dispiritedly concerning this
very thing. The encounter with Leslie Cairns and
Doris Monroe had brought it foremost to her mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder how long Miss Monroe has known
Miss Cairns?” she now mused aloud.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Long enough to know better. There you go
again, worrying over that selfish iceberg,” Muriel
cried impatiently. “I might beneficently warn her
against the snares of the Hob-goblin, but would she
be grateful? Far from it. No, no, Muriel. Never
contemplate such folly.” Muriel answered her own
question in a prim, horrified tone.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“I quite agree with Muriel,” Marjorie smiled
faintly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some of the upper class girls may tell her a few
things about Leslie Cairns. They’d not forget her
and the Sans in a hurry. If you had to room with
her you’d lose your crush on her. She’s exasperating.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t help admiring her. She is so beautiful,”
Marjorie made frank avowal. “I always have to
stop and remember that she isn’t amiable. There
was one thing in particular that I noticed on the
night last summer when we invited her downstairs
to Miss Remson’s spread. She was truthful. She
didn’t say she was too tired, or make any other excuses.
She said flatly that she <i>didn’t care to come
downstairs</i>. Again, afterward, when we were in
Vera’s car and met her out walking one Sunday
afternoon, we asked her to ride with us. She refused
our invitation in the same scornful way. Still it
was the <i>real</i> way she felt. A girl who wouldn’t
bother to deceive others must have principle,” Marjorie
earnestly advanced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hum-m. That remains to be seen.” Muriel
was not thus easily convinced. “But will I be the
one to see? At present the Ice Queen and I are
as intimate as the North and South Poles. We
don’t even study at the same table.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“Poor old Muriel. Was it lonesome?” Marjorie
flung an arm across Muriel’s shoulders. They were
now turning in at the flagstone walk in front of
Silverton Hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it was,” grumbled Muriel. “But it’s my
own fault. I took that half a room to please myself.
You girls ought to appreciate me and make
a fuss over me because I refused to be separated
from the Sanfordites.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll call a special meeting after the Travelers
go tonight and remind the Sanfordites of their
duty,” Marjorie teasingly promised as they went
up the steps of the Hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>The blended harmony of violin and piano outside
Robin Page’s room halted the visitors before the
closed door. They had no more than willingly
paused to listen when the music stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My last A string,” mourned a voice. “I’ll have
to go clear to town for another. How provoking!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie knocked three times in quick succession
on the door, hers and Robin’s particular rap. There
was a scurry of light feet across the floor then
Robin joyfully opened the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What luck!” she exulted as she did a pleased
little prance around the callers. “I was coming
over to Wayland Hall directly after dinner. I’ve
such a lot of things to get off my chest.” She sighed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I’m fairly stuffed with responsibility. Hello, Muriel
Harding. I haven’t seen you for as much as
two days. Where have you been keeping yourself?
I want you for a singing number I’m going to have
in our first show. We’re going to open with a revue,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My A string just snapped,” Phyllis Moore was
ruefully informing Marjorie. “So aggravating. I
was going to put in two hours of practice this evening.
The only store in Hamilton where I can get
another string closes at five o’clock. Goodness
knows when I’ll be imbued again with such a laudable
desire to practice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You couldn’t practice tonight if you had fifty A
strings,” Marjorie told her. “The time has come
to open the box, Phil.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, lovely!” Phyllis’ charming face lighted with
pleasure. “Away with practice.” She waved both
arms outward with a buoyant releasing gesture.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re to come over to Wayland Hall now; you
and Robin. Where’s Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In her room, stuck with a theme. Hope she’s
struggled through it by this time. If she hasn’t,
I’ll make her leave it; just as though it was a finished
literary triumph. I’ll go for her now.” Phil
dashed out the door and down the hall to Barbara
Severn’s room.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>She returned in an incredibly short space of time
with Barbara, the latter in outdoor attire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, Red Bird,” greeted Muriel. “Who so
gay as you?” She shook Barbara by both hands,
then turned her around so as to inspect her coat
and cap of a wonderful shade of deep crimson, the
gorgeous hue accentuated by wide collar, cuffs and
bandings of bear’s fur. “What a love of a coat
and cap!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Isn’t it, though? I am always planning to waylay
Barbara on the campus some fine dark evening
and strip her of that de luxe red coat and cap.”
Phil made threatening eyes at Barbara.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m safe. She doesn’t quite dare risk her dignity
as president of the senior class,” laughed Barbara.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin had already donned her wraps. It took
energetic Phil not more than a minute to snatch her
own smart coat of gray tweed from its accustomed
hanger. She pulled a black soft Tam-o’-shanter
with its huge fluffy black pom-pom down upon her
crinkling yellow-brown hair at a truly artistic angle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Phil looks more like a wandering musician than
ever in that Tam,” was Marjorie’s admiring opinion.
The individuality of Phyllis’ clothes and the
careless, artistic grace with which the tall, supple
girl wore them were a joy to Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Down the stairs and out of the house trooped the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>five friends, bent on making as good time to Wayland
Hall as they could. Robin, Phil and Marjorie
were anxious to have a talk before dinner about the
program for the coming revue and their entertainment
plans for Thanksgiving. Muriel had decided
to go to town with Jerry and Leila in the car to
help buy the eats for the spread. Barbara was eager
to see Lucy Warner and glean from her certain biological
pointers of which she stood in need. The
group sped across the campus, reaching the Hall
at just five o’clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No mail for Muriel. What’s the matter with
the population of Sanford that I don’t get any letters?”
Muriel demanded severely as she turned away
disappointedly from the Hall bulletin board.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had no idea of your vast importance in Sanford,”
giggled Barbara. “You talk as though you
were the mayor of the town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not yet,” grinned Muriel. “I may be the mayoress
of Sanford some day—say in about a hundred
years from now.” She duplicated Barbara’s
giggle. “Marjorie’s the scintillating social star of
Sanford.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie said not a word as she picked several
letters from the bulletin board. Her eyes were glowing
like stars at the harvest of mail. There was a
letter from General; another from Captain; a third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in Mary Raymond’s neat vertical script, had come
from far-off Colorado. There was a fourth from
Constance Armitage. Fifth and last was a letter
in the sprawling childish writing of Charlie Stevens.
She and Charlie, the latter now grown into a tall
sturdy youngster of thirteen, were regular and enthusiastic
correspondents.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the rack above her own mail she caught sight
of two letters for Jerry. One of them was in Helen
Trent’s familiar hand. The other—A swift blush
overspread Marjorie’s cheeks as she took the two
letters from the board and placed them with her
own. She knew only too well whose hand had
dashed the address across the envelope.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immersed as she had been in college matters she
had given her old pal, Hal Macy, scant thought
since her return to Hamilton campus. Sight of his
letter to Jerry gave her pause; reminded her of
something which intruded itself upon her not quite
agreeably. Hal had not answered the latest letter
she had written him. It had really been a long
while since she had heard from him.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>LOYAL TO NO ONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the dining-room at Wayland Hall that evening
plenty of curious and speculative glances were cast
at the round dozen of Hamilton’s staunchest children
as they made merry at a special table which
Miss Remson had provided for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the next table to theirs the five Bertram
girls exchanged occasional laughing signals and remarks
with the distinguished little group of post
graduates, seniors and one member of the faculty,
the youngest though she happened to be. Aside
from the warm friendliness of Gussie Forbes and
her four chums there emanated from the other table
of girls a peculiarly chilling atmosphere. It hinted
of displeasure; a displeasure which stopped just
this side of hostility.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sophs and freshies in the house can’t see us
for a minute,” Jerry said to Leila in an undertone
as they were awaiting the serving of the dessert.
“Feel the chill. Get me?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Tell me nothing.” Leila cast a grim glance
about the dining-room. Suddenly her grimness vanished
into a characteristic flash of white teeth which
always signified her utter amusement. “It is the
Battle of Wayland Hall we shall be fighting before
spring with a number of distinguished P. G. generals
in the thick of the fray. It is the sophs who
are ready now to roar at us. The freshies here
will but echo the sophs’ roars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wayland Hall has been a regular hot-bed of
trouble since the soph president was elected.” Jerry
used the same guarded tones. “With Gus and the
disappointed Ice Queen under the same roof can
you wonder?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot.” Leila’s shrug was eloquent. “I have
not been so completely disgusted with a set of girls
since the bad days of the Sans.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad days of the Sans?” Vera, seated at Leila’s
left, had caught the Irish girl’s words. She now
repeated them inquiringly. “What tales of ancient
history am I hearing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ancient history that is trying to repeat itself,”
Leila returned with dry sarcasm. “I have been
muttering in Jeremiah’s ear that we are not favorites
at the Hall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a case of top-lofty sophs and freshie-fresh
freshmen.” Vera gave a wise nod. “The traditional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>meek and lowly freshie is rapidly becoming
an almost extinct species.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it would appear this year,” Jerry agreed with
an appraising survey of the long dining-room. Her
glance rested for a moment on Doris Monroe, then
traveled on to the students who sat at table with
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are the members of the trouble bureau,”
she told Leila. “Look in the direction I’m looking
and you’ll know who I mean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard something about a trouble bureau.” Marjorie,
next to Jerry on Jerry’s right, bent a laughing
face forward to her room-mate. “What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“First time I ever head you commit a Cairns-ism.
For further information about the trouble
bureau, find the Ice Queen,” Jerry directed not without
humor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh; I understand. But I won’t look down at
her. If she happened to see us looking at her she
would probably be offended, just as Gussie Forbes
was when she noticed us eyeing her the first time
we saw her at Baretti’s. I learned a lesson then.
I don’t intend to make the same mistake again.”
Marjorie spoke with the utmost good humor. She
was not preaching to her chums, and they knew it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Merely because you’re such an old friend of
mine, Bean, to confide in you doesn’t mean that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>I’m gossiping, I’ll say a word or two about the
trouble bureau. That tall soph with the straight
black hair, black moon eyes and pasty-white face is
the chief disturber. She seems to be directing the
Ice Queen’s campaign. Muriel says she comes to
see Miss Monroe about every half hour until the
ten-thirty bell puts the kibosh on her visits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Unlike Marjorie, Jerry could not refrain from
voicing her disapproval of Doris Monroe and her
group of sophomore satellites living at Wayland
Hall. “The next agitator to Moon Eyes is the
pudgy, red-haired soph with the mechanical voice.
Their real names happen to be Miss Peyton and Miss
Carter, but Muriel and I have made a few changes,”
Jerry declared with a whole-hearted grin. “Ahem!
We call the pair the Prime Minister and the Phonograph.
So true to life! What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie, Leila and Vera could not help laughing
at the names Jerry and Muriel had waggishly applied
to the two sophs. Miss Carter’s speech had
a habit of clicking itself from her lips with the mechanical
precision of a phonograph. She had a
wooden manner of carriage and walk which further
added to the impression she gave of something mechanical. As
for the name Muriel had picked for
moon-eyed Miss Peyton, Muriel herself probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>best understood thus far its fitness as applied to the
tall, austere looking young woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The traditions of Hamilton say nothing about
the naming habit.” Leila shot a playful glance at
Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Er-r—well, it’s remembering the stranger within
our gate in a kind of way,” Jerry defended. “Now
that Muriel and I have named ’em specially we can
remember ’em so much the better.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such ignoble sentiments from a Hamilton P. G.!
I am shocked!” Vera’s small hands went up in simulated
displeasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll get over the shock if you don’t stop to
think about it,” Jerry assured her. “You may even
learn to admire the Harding-Macy classification.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s certainly time the Travelers got together,”
Leila said, now more than half serious in her observation.
“We must protect the Hall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am with you in that, Leila,” Marjorie observed,
the light of sudden, unalterable purpose flaring
strongly in her eyes. “We have Miss Remson as well
as the girls here to think of. We’ve been through
a siege of a house divided against itself once here.
We must somehow not let that calamity overtake
the Hall again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How are we going to stop it, Marvelous Manager,
with Gentleman Gus and the Ice Queen all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>ready to challenge each other to a duel?” quizzed
Jerry. “I don’t say it can’t be done. I have great
faith in you and your works, Bean.” She beamed
patronizingly. “I merely ask you: How is it going
to be done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I knew,” Marjorie laughingly confessed.
“The Travelers will have to find a way to teach our
freshies and sophs here to live up to the Hymn of
Hamilton. That means we’ll have to teach them
without letting them know they are being taught.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry looked impishly impressed. “What a simple
pleasant task!” she exclaimed with pretended
enthusiasm. “I should say we’d better cut out dessert,
go right upstairs and plan for it. What’s dessert?
Nothing but fresh cocoanut layer-cake and
coffee gelatine slathered with whipped cream. Who
cares for any such trifles?” Jerry waved an airy
hand. She made no move to leave her chair, however.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only you. The rest of us have no longing for
sweet stuff. But we are so kind as to keep you company
while you eat,” Leila made bland assurance.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the dessert was served the Irish girl deftly
abstracted Jerry’s portion of cake and gelatine from
under Jerry’s eyes and before the waitress had more
than placed the dishes on the table. Up the line
went the cake and gelatine until they reached Phil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>who sat at the head of the table. Phil welcomed
them with effusion and grew tantalizing. She gave a
dozen flimsy reasons supposed to justify her claim to
it. The table rang with laughter so spontaneous and
good-natured more than one of the freshmen at the
Hall felt a secret sympathy spring up within for the
girls whom they had heard characterized by Doris
Monroe’s most ardent supporters as “meddlers and
hypocrites” and of having shown marked favoritism.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If we were to make half the noise they are making
Miss Remson would call us to account for it,”
sourly observed Julia Peyton to Clara Carter. “I’ve
spoken to her several times about the racket that
goes on every evening in Miss Forbes’ room and in
that Miss Dean’s room, too. It’s been worse since
Miss Harding came to the Hall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it,” Miss Carter nodded an eager red
head. “Doris says she simply won’t allow Miss
Harding to carry on in her room the way she does
when she’s with her own crowd. She’s generally
to be found on the campus with some of them,
screaming and laughing. Doris met her and Miss
Dean when she was with that awfully rich Miss
Cairns this very afternoon. She said she felt so
mortified at being obliged to speak to Miss Harding.
She doesn’t speak to Miss Dean at all. She told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>me she had good reasons for ignoring <i>her</i>, but she
preferred not to give them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph.” Julia cast a jealous glance at her
companion as the two sophomores rose to leave the
table. Each girl was jealous of the condescending
friendship which Doris Monroe had chosen to give
her companion. She felt that she stood a trifle
closer to Doris than the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris was fully aware of this state of affairs.
When she had recovered from the sweetness of
her first triumph at being “rushed” she made up
her mind not to allow her soph and freshie admirers
to fail in allegiance to her banner. She soon learned
that her selfish air of indifference was one of her
greatest assets. It added individuality to her beauty.
It impressed her worshippers with a high idea of
the value of her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had inherited this trait of indifference from
her mother, whose counterpart she was. She had,
as Marjorie suspected, a strong inclination to honesty,
one of her father’s finest traits. Thus she
could not have pretended an indifference she did
not feel. Since it was in her soul to be this she
accepted the benefits she received from it with secret
satisfaction. She was privately glad that she
had no desire to be impulsive and readily responsive.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“<i>I</i> heard that the Miss Cairns you mentioned was
expelled from Hamilton College,” Julia said disagreeably.
She was desirous of over-topping
Clara’s boastful reference to “Doris” and the intimacy
it implied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who told you?” Clara’s tone was challenging.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll not say who. I heard it, and it came to me
directly from someone who knew,” Julia made mysterious
response.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I—haven’t heard any such story as that. I
don’t believe it’s true. I’ll ask Doris. <i>She’ll</i> tell
me,” Clara ended, tossing her flame-colored head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re very foolish to think of asking Doris,”
disapproved Julia, her shaggy black brows drawing
together. “She’ll set you down as impertinent.
Even if she should know she wouldn’t tell <i>you</i>.”
She gave a short, sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not afraid to ask her,” Clara doggedly persisted.
“<i>You</i> may be, but <i>I’m</i> not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was the beginning of an angry discussion
between the two sophomores which lasted all the way
upstairs and for several minutes after the door of
their room was slammed behind them by Clara. So
vigorously did she slam it that the sharp sound
reached the bevy of Travelers as they came trooping
gaily upstairs. Robin was singing softly for them
an old plantation song: “Get you ready there’s a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>meetin’ here tonight,” and Phil was patting her
hands in time to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bing, bang; who fired the first shot?” exclaimed
Muriel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It did sound almost like a shot, didn’t it? I
haven’t heard such a splendid imitation of banging
a door since the Sans used to vent their outraged
feelings on the doors,” chuckled Vera.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may have been the first shot fired in the
Battle of Wayland Hall,” Jerry gigglingly surmised
to Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then it was wasted on us,” laughed Leila. “It
will take more than the banging of a few doors to
rouse our ire to the point of battle. Though make
no mistake: ‘The air is full of knives,’ as we say
in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the room occupied by Clara Carter and Julia
Peyton the air was indeed full of verbal knives.
Both had voted for Doris Monroe for president of
the sophomore class. Both had pledged themselves,
with certain other girls at the Hall, to “boost” Doris
and “down” Augusta Forbes. Now they were
squabbling fiercely over the lovely, indifferent object
of their girl devotion. In their jealous anger
with each other they had blindly overlooked the old
saying: “In union there is strength.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>TESTING TWO TRAVELERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Remember, friends and fellow Travelers, this is
a serious occasion.” Ronny, as president of the original
Five Travelers, stood facing her companions
who had disposed themselves four in a row on Jerry’s
couch-bed and on chairs in alignment with the couch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s not very serious any of us are looking, nor
our worthy president, either,” Leila declared, throwing
Ronny a twinkling glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never judge by appearances—so very reckless,
don’t you know,” Ronny rebuked, her charming face
full of mischief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On with the meeting. No stops allowed for repartee.
We’ve a lot to do, and a spread to eat up
afterward,” Jerry announced in her most judicial
tones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you for your delicate reminder that time
is flying, Jeremiah.” Ronny made Jerry a deep bow,
meant to convey her humble gratitude. “As I was
about to say when I was interrupted”—Ronny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>stared hard at Leila—“we are to pass upon the
names written on slips in this box.” She held up a
small square box of ornamental brass.</p>

<p class='c005'>During their initial railway journey to Hamilton
College more than four years previous the quintette
of Sanford chums had helped while away the long
hours on the train by banding themselves into a
private, informal club which they named the Five
Travelers’ Club. They had found interest in looking
upon themselves as five travelers about to explore
the unknown country of College.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little association had flourished and been a
comfort to them during their freshman year. Every
now and then, as the journey through the country of
college continued they had added a member to the
group. When Commencement and the end of their
proscribed course came the still informal club had
become the Nineteen Travelers.</p>

<p class='c005'>It had become the earnest desire of the Nineteen
Travelers to perpetuate the club as a sorority.
After much discussion it had been decided to leave
it as a parting gift to nineteen seniors. Due to the
multiplicity of duties which the original Nineteen
Travelers had pledged themselves to perform, the
organization of the new sorority was left, unfortunately,
until the last minute. By that time several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>new-fledged seniors, eligible to membership, had departed
for their homes.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Ronny who had then proposed that each
Traveler should write on a slip of paper her choice
of senior to succeed her. The slips were to be placed
in a box, without having been examined, and the box
placed in Miss Remson’s care until the return the
next fall of the post graduate Travelers to Hamilton
College. To them would be intrusted the forming
of the new sorority.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel confident,” Ronny continued, “that the seniors
whose names are in this box are the very girls
we most wish to carry on our club. Still, in the
event that any one of you may have an objection
to a name as read out by me, I will count ten slowly
after the reading of each name. Anyone who may
make objection must say ‘no’ within the count, and
afterward frankly state her reason for so doing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With this preamble Ronny put a hand in the box,
drew from it a slip and solemnly read out: “Phyllis
Moore.” The laughing gleam in her gray eyes did
not accord with her solemn face. “One, two——”
she began.</p>

<p class='c005'>A chorus of laughter drowned her voice, mingled
with cries of: “No; no, indeed! I object.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mercy on us!” Up went Ronny’s hands. “Such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>strenuous objections! Sh-h-h. Be calm and state
our objections, one at a time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can’t decide as to her qualifications for membership
until she has been put to the test,” boldly demanded
Lillian Wenderblatt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” Ronny agreed with the utmost amiability.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor me.” Phil groaned audibly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would suggest that action be suspended on the
candidate to be tested until the other names have
been passed upon. In the event that there may be
other candidates for the test they may then be put
to the ordeal together.” Marjorie made this sly proviso,
and with apparent innocence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Other candidates!” exclaimed Barbara Severn.
“I know only one other besides Phil. Poor me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Barbara Severn.” Ronny promptly read out her
name. Another burst of vigorous, laughing “Noes”
ascended. Barbara was also condemned to the test.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the Nineteen Travelers’ senior year at
Hamilton they had more than once invited Phil and
Barbara to become members of the club. Both had
refused the invitation, preferring to receive their
election as a parting gift from their elder sisters.
They had been as invaluable to the Travelers, however,
as though they had been members. Now their
comrades proposed to show appreciation in their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>peculiar fashion. None of the seventeen other names
which Ronny read out for the august consideration
of the Travelers were challenged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure you will be pleased to hear that Miss
Mason and Jer—Miss Macy will conduct the test,”
Ronny purred to the hapless candidates.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right, half call me Jeremiah. Everyone’s
only about half respectful to me,” grumbled Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, we’re de-lighted,” Barbara and Phil together
satirically responded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So glad. As all appear to be pleased let the test
begin,” Ronny smiled encouragingly on the candidates.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ahem-m! Candidates rise and come forward.
Stand there; exactly in line,” Jerry dictated grandly.
“You will now listen to Miss Mason while she explains
to you the nature of the first test.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vera came smilingly toward the two girls. “Here
is a penny for each of you,” she said generously.
“You are not to spend it for candy. No, no.” She
shook a forbidding finger at them. “You are to get
down on the floor and each shove your penny to the
door and”—she beamed beneficently on her victims—“with
your nose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woof-f!” Phil made a despairing gesture.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can never do it,” giggled Barbara, “but I’ll
try.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“We are waiting.” Vera sweetly indicated the
place on the rug on which the unlucky candidates
were to prostrate themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>Phil was first to obey. Barbara paused to watch
her and learn the way such a feat was to be performed.
It took Phil not more than a minute to
discover that creeping as a means of locomotion
would not aid her penny’s progress to the door. She
was obliged to lie flat to the floor, face downward,
and wriggle very slowly toward the goal, aiming
constant dabs at the penny with her nose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her gallant progress in spite of odds so entertained
Barbara she had to be reminded of her part
in the test. She proved not nearly as skillful as Phil
in the art of penny-shoving. Meanwhile the room
rang with laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The candidates will now be allowed a breathing
spell while I consult with my valued assistant and
prepare the next degree,” was Jerry’s gracious announcement
after Phil had triumphantly pushed her
penny the required distance and Barbara had shoved
hers over half way to the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next degree appeared in the form of two
rows of potatoes, placed at short distances apart. At
one end of each row was a basket. Jerry handed Phil
and Barbara each a teaspoon and assigned them to
a potato row. “Start at this end. Pick up the potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>on your teaspoon and carry them to the basket,”
was her next bland instruction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That sounds easy,” sighed Barbara. “Oh, my
nose,” she tenderly rubbed it.</p>

<p class='c005'>To balance a good-sized potato on a teaspoon and
carry it across a room is a feat which requires practice.
Phyllis and Barbara were novices at it. They
toiled patiently at the ridiculous task while the Travelers
had a hilarious time at their expense. Before
either had succeeded in placing more than two or
three potatoes in their baskets Vera called them off
the job.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to take your will for the deed,” she
told them. “Your sense of balance seems to be
sadly lacking. Don’t be discouraged. Both of you
have splendid useful noses even if your potato
carrying was wobbly. You’ve done nobly. Now we
are going to give you a feed. I hope you won’t mind
being blindfolded for a little while. It’s quite necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing could please us more,” Phil assured extravagantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoever heard of an initiation without the candidates
were blindfolded? Go as far as you like.”
Barbara was equally gracious.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry proceeded to blindfold the two in her business-like way.
Next she motioned to Vera, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>brought forward two bungalow aprons. She and
Vera politely assisted Phil and Barbara into the
aprons. The pair were then led to chairs and ordered
to be seated.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the top shelf of her dress closet Jerry took
a square pasteboard box. Opened, two immense,
shining cream puffs were revealed. Laughter greeted
the sight of them. The other Travelers recognized
the puffs as having come from a certain bakery
in the town of Hamilton where the size of the dainty
and its extra-generous cream filling had popularized
it among the Hamilton College girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Phyllis Marie Moore; you can’t say I never
treated you. In the absence of plates, hold out both
hands.” Jerry lifted one of the huge puffs from
the box and carefully set it in Phil’s obediently outstretched
hands. She then went through the same
performance with Barbara as the recipient. “Eat
them nicely,” she admonished with wicked significance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eat them nicely,” mimicked Barbara. “I can’t
eat a cream puff nicely when I can see every bite I
take of it. Blindfolded—good night!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’re awfully good anyway,” consoled Phil.
She held the puff in one hand and went cautiously
over the humps and bumps of the big pastry shell.
She boldly attacked a corner which promised not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>let out too copiously the fairly thin cream filling.
She did very well until she had eaten away enough
of the shell to court disaster. It would have been
hard enough to eat the puff daintily had she been
able to see it. Minus sight and a plate or paper
napkin on which to place it she soon managed to
smear her face, hands and apron liberally with
cream. She ate away desperately but there appeared
to be twice as much filling as should have been.</p>

<p class='c005'>Barbara did far worse at puff eating than Phyllis.
Her frantic efforts to keep the cream within the
bounds of its crisp brown shell sent her companions
into shrieks of laughter. Worse still for them, Jerry
had decreed that they could not wipe either hands
or faces until she gave the word.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the midst of the fun Marjorie obeyed a sudden
impulse to leave the room and stand in the hall outside
the door for a moment. She slipped away unnoticed,
anxious to ascertain how plainly the laughter
and talk of her companies sounded from outside.
She and Jerry had hung three heavy portieres which
Miss Remson had given them before the door leading
into the hall and before the doors of the two
dress closets. The manager had assured her that
the portieres would serve to a great extent to deaden
sounds from within the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>She smiled her relieved satisfaction after she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>listened intently for three or four minutes. She
could hear only faintly the sounds of conversation
mingled with laughter. She was of the opinion that
such sounds would not be disturbing to any student
on the same floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Watchman, tell us of the night,” hailed Jerry as
Marjorie again stepped into the room. “I know
what you’ve been doing. You’ve been listening to
how noisy we are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right-o, Jeremiah. And we haven’t been disgracefully
noisy, after all,” Marjorie gaily assured.
“While the girls were laughing loudest at Barbara
and Phil I stole out of here into the hall. I wanted
to find out, if I could, just how noisy we were. That
heavy curtain we hung over the door shuts the sound
in beautifully. You can only hear it faintly from
the hall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good work, Bean; good work.” Jerry patted
Marjorie on the back. “We’ve two more stunts to
put Phil and Barbara through yet and the crowd is
getting hilariouser and hilariouser. Listen to them
now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A fresh gale of mirth testified to the truth of
Jerry’s remarks. It assaulted Marjorie’s critical ears
with almost dismaying force. Reminded of what
she had just proven to her own satisfaction she grew
reassured. Since that day, early in the fall, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Doris Monroe had reported the joyful little welcome
party in Gussie Forbes’ room to Miss Remson as
disturbing to her peace Marjorie and Jerry had been
expecting the same dire fate would overtake them.
Their room was the Travelers’ headquarters as well
as a favorite haunt of the five Bertram girls. “It’s
our positive good fortune that we escaped thus far,”
Marjorie had more than once told Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>In itself to have been reported to Miss Remson as
disturbers would not have troubled Marjorie and
Jerry. Understanding between them and the brisk
little manager of the Hall was complete. It was
their standing as post graduates, their college honor
which they prided themselves upon. As post graduates
they would be first to be weighed in the balance.
They ardently desired not to be found wanting
even in small things.</p>

<p class='c005'>What Marjorie had not known when she returned
to Room 15 after her brief moment of listening in
the hall was that she had been observed. Across the
hall from Room 15 two interested sophomores had
kept diligent watch since the Travelers had come upstairs
from dinner. With their own door a few
stealthy inches ajar they had heard, or imagined they
heard, what they had been longing to hear—noise
enough from “those tiresome, interfering P.G.’s” to
warrant prompt action on their part.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A LEADING QUESTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Action came while Phil and Barbara were engaged
in removing at least a third of the creamy contents
of the puffs from faces, hands, necks and even
hair. They “cleaned up” amidst the laughter and
gay raillery of their friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How much more must we endure?” demanded
Barbara as she dried her cleansed features with a
Turkish towel and began lightly powdering them at
the mirror.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, not so much,” tantalized Jerry. “There are
a few more little stunts that——” Two imperative
raps on the door sent Jerry hurrying to it. She
pushed the portiere to one side; swung open the door
to confront the tall, squarely-built sophomore whom
she had nicknamed the Prime Minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good evening,” she said in level tones. Her keen
eyes were missing nothing. Her mind leaped at once
to the nature of the other girl’s intrusion, for such
it was.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Good evening.” Her salutation was returned
with haughty aggression. In fact every line of the
sophomore’s broad face and stiff, unyielding figure
spelled aggression. Her peculiarly round black eyes,
blacker in contrast to the unhealthy white of her
skin, resentfully searched Jerry up and down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish to speak to Miss Dean at once,” she demanded.
“I know she is here.” She eyed Jerry belligerently,
as though to forestall a denial on her
part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course she is here. We are entertaining our
friends.” Jerry’s matter-of-fact reply brought a dull
flush to Miss Peyton’s pale cheeks. “Will you come
in?” The concise invitation had a certain restraining
effect upon the frowning caller.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I will not,” she refused, her own inflexion
rude. “Ask Miss Dean to come to the door. I wish
to speak to her, and to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well.” Jerry appeared non-committal.
“Just a moment.” She turned away from the door
and beckoned to Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie left Barbara and Phil, whom she had
been assisting in the removal of the sticky traces of
the puff test, and walked quickly to the door. In
that brief second on the way to it a flash of dismay
visited her. It drove from her eyes the light of
laughter occasioned by Phil’s and Barbara’s complaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>nonsense as they scrubbed faces and hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Jerry?” she asked as she reached her
room-mate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry opened the door wider and made room for
Marjorie in the doorway beside her. “Miss Peyton
has something she wishes to say to us.” Jerry’s
round face was enigmatic. Marjorie had but to
glance at it to read there what others might not.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the room the buzz of conversation had
lessened to a mere murmur. Muriel had been entertaining
her chums with a flow of her funny nonsense.
Even she had run down suddenly, seized by
the same surmise which had occurred to her companions.
Too courteous to stare boldly toward the
door, canny conjecture as to the caller’s errand temporarily
halted the will to talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good evening, Miss Peyton.” Marjorie’s straight
glance into the soph’s smouldering eyes was courteously
inquiring. Ordinarily she might have followed
the greeting with a pleasantry. What she
read in Julia Peyton’s face held her silent; waiting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come to speak to you and Miss Macy about
the noise you have been making this evening,” blurted
the sophomore, dropping all pretense of courtesy.
“It is not only tonight I speak of. Almost every
other night we have been annoyed by the noise in
your room. It makes study impossible. We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>endured it without complaining, but we have had
every reason for reporting it. Tonight you and your
friends have been more annoying than usual. I decided
the time had come to let you know it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Before she could say more Marjorie broke in
evenly with: “It is true that there is a larger party
of girls than usual in our room tonight. We have
been conducting an informal meeting of a club of
which we are members. We spoke to Miss Remson
beforehand, asking permission to hold the meeting
in our room. We——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, <i>Miss Remson</i>!” was the contemptuous exclamation.
“She cannot be depended upon for fairness.
We understand where her sympathies lie. We
have spoken to her——” The sophomore stopped
abruptly, caught in a contradiction of her own previous
statement of not having complained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me. I understood you to say that you
had not complained.” Jerry could not resist a lightning
opportunity to discomfit the other girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should have said that we had not—that we—that
we had not reported you to President
Matthews,” amended Miss Peyton, glancing angrily
at Jerry. Aggressive from the start she was fast
losing her temper.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot allow you to accuse Miss Remson of
unfairness without offering my strongest defense in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>her behalf.” Righteous indignation lent sternness
to Marjorie’s clear tones. “She is never unfair. She
is always dependable. Since you have said that you
reported us to her, I must believe you. She has not
mentioned the matter to us. That means she does
not consider us at fault.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, certainly she doesn’t,” was the sarcastic retort
accompanied by a significant shrug of the square
shoulders. “<i>That is precisely the trouble.</i>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please allow me to finish what I had begun to
say to you.” Marjorie made a dignified little gesture.
“On the day when Miss Monroe reported Miss
Forbes and a few of us who were in her room welcoming
her back to college, we talked things over
with Miss Remson. Since then we have been more
careful not to give offense to other students at the
Hall than at any time during our past four years at
Hamilton. Miss Remson gave us heavy portieres
to hang before the doors when we expected to entertain
a number of girls. These deaden the sound.
You can see for yourself how heavy and closely-woven
this one is.” Marjorie took hold of a fold of
the portiere. “I purposely went into the hall tonight
and closed the door after me to find out if we were
too noisy. I was surprised at the small amount of
noise that came from our room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am surprised to hear such statements from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>post graduate.” Julia Peyton gave a discomfited
sarcastic laugh. “Frankly, Miss Dean, I have been
so disappointed in you. When first I came to Hamilton
I had the greatest respect for you. I regret
that I should have been obliged to change that opinion.”
Julia believed she had said something extremely
telling. “Yes; and I do not approve of the
way your post graduate friends have tried to run
Wayland Hall. It surely does not add to Miss Langly’s
credit as a member of the faculty,” she ended in
malicious triumph. She was inwardly furious at
Marjorie’s and Jerry’s quiet but determined defense
of their own conduct.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your harsh opinion of our friends is not justified.”
Marjorie’s curt proud tones contained censure.
“Let me advise you to be careful and not repeat
such opinions on the campus. Our friends
would not suffer as a result. They are known to be
true to the traditions of Hamilton. You would
merely succeed in creating unpleasantness for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care for your advice.” Miss Peyton
blazed into sudden wrath. “You are only trying to
frighten me into not reporting you and your friends.
You meant yourself, too, but you were clever enough
not to include yourself in your remarks. I shall report
the whole affair to President Matthews; not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>later than tomorrow morning.” She whirled angrily;
started across the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait a minute.” Something in Jerry’s tone
arrested the miffed soph’s progress. “I’d like to ask
you a question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?” Miss Peyton put untold frost into the
interrogation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why”—Jerry paused—“if you and your room-mate
were so greatly disturbed by our noise, did you
not close your door? That would have at least
helped considerably to shut out the noise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our door was—” began the soph furiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Partly open,” supplied Jerry. “I am quite sure
it was,” she continued sweetly, “because I happened
to go into the hall and saw for myself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>“Stung, and by the truth!” Jerry gave an exultant
skip into their room behind Marjorie and hastily
closed the door. Miss Peyton, confronted by unassailable
truth, had no defense ready. She glared
wrathfully at Jerry and Marjorie and hurriedly disappeared
into her room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can guess what it’s all about,” greeted Muriel
Harding. “We ought to be shocked and amazed,
Marvelous Manager, at <i>you</i> for fussing. We might
expect it of Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You might; you bet you might. I’d have done
all the fussing this time if Marjorie hadn’t begun
answering that trouble hunter first. Believe me Leila,
the first attack in the Battle of Wayland Hall was
made right at our door. I’m happy to announce
that the enemy was sent fleeing across the hall with
one good hot shot fired by the Travelers’ friend,
J. J. G. Macy. <i>I’m the one.</i>” Jerry proudly
thumped her chest.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Could you hear what we were saying?” Marjorie
glanced interestedly about the half circle of
girls, eagerly formed around her. “I know you
would try <i>not</i> to listen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We could hear only a word now and then,” Vera
made haste to answer. “Of course it was a complaint
about us. What is the matter with these
sophs? They weren’t so obstreperous last year as
freshies?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I took Miss Peyton to the freshman hop last
year,” said Lillian Wenderblatt. “As a Traveler in
the midst of Travelers I may say she was very ungracious
to me. I accepted her rudeness as not having
been intentional; laid it to her natural manner.
Since I’ve heard her rated as the rudest student on
the campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gussie Forbes says that the freshies who made
life hard for her and her pals last year are the
sophs who are trying to do it again this year,” said
Phyllis Moore.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gussie is a wise child. And with Muriel’s celebrated
Ice Queen to add to the snarl what hope is
there for a few poor old P. G. ladies who had hoped
to live out their days in peace on the campus? Oh,
wurra, wurra!” Leila crossed her hands over her
breast, clutched her shoulders with her fingers,
thrust out her chin and rocked herself to and fro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>with the appearance of a mourning old woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a dandy old woman you make, Leila. I’m
going to cast you for an old hag part in a melodrama,
if I can find a good one. The campus is
howling for a truly lurid one with outlaws, an abducted
child, a lost heiress, an old hag and various
other nice pleasant little characters.” Robin was
always on the lookout for features. “We can ask
three dollars a seat for a zipping old ‘dramer’ and
crowd the gym.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a good deal more pleasant to talk of shows
than fusses,” Marjorie declared, smiling at Robin’s
latest ambition. Glancing up at the wall clock she
gave a quick exclamation. “Jerry,” she cried, “we’ll
have to trot out the spread instanter!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t I know it. I’ve already begun.” Jerry
made a dive toward her closet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about those two stunts for the candidates?”
Lucy Warner caught Jerry by an arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Luciferous, how you do like to see people
get into trouble, don’t you?” grinned Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucy’s grave, studious face relaxed into the wide,
utterly pleased smile which Muriel and Jerry both
enjoyed calling to it. She broke into the funny little
half giggle, half gurgle which was always productive
of laughter in others.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The <i>idea</i>, <i>Luciferous</i>, of your calling attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to poor Barbara and me after all we’ve suffered!”
Phil turned reproachful blue eyes on Lucy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I’m not so mean as you think me,” Lucy’s
odd greenish eyes flashed warm lights of fun. “It
was a case of either stunts or eats. It’s going to
be eats, so good night stunts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Good night stunts,’” repeated Muriel. “You
never learned them words from Prexy Matthews,
Luciferous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should hope not,” chuckled Lucy. “All the
slang I know I learned from you and Jeremiah.
Kindly remember that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish to forget it immediately,” Muriel looked
askance at the accusation.</p>

<p class='c005'>With the hands of the clock pointing to ten minutes
to ten Marjorie and Jerry, with Leila’s and
Vera’s help rushed the eatables for the spread to
the center table. Leila had furnished a box of Irish
sweet crackers and a case of imported ginger ale.
The ginger ale had arrived only the day before from
across the ocean. Sweet pickles, stuffed olives,
stuffed dates, salted almonds and small fancy cakes
comprised the lay-out. There had been no time to
make sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Supplied with paper napkins and paper plates the
guests helped themselves to the spread. They formed
in an irregular group on each side of Jerry’s couch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>which held its usual four of their number. Marjorie
and Jerry seated themselves on the floor in front
of the couch bed. Unintentionally they formed the
center of the group.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At last you can tell us what was said at the
door,” sighed Robin. “It isn’t curious to want to
know, since we are concerned in it, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you to know,” Marjorie reflectively bit
into a maccaroon. “I’ll try to repeat as exactly as I
can what was said. Then you’ll understand the
situation better.” She recounted the conversation
which had taken place at the door between herself
and Miss Peyton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Report us to Prexy; the idea!” scoffed Lillian
Wenderblatt. “She is an ambitious trouble hunter.
She’ll find plenty of troubles if she carries any such
tale to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should say as much!” was Vera’s indignant
cry. “Imagine a soph reporting P. G.’s and double
P. G.’s and faculty and the P. G. daughter of Professor
Wenderblatt! Not to mention Prexy’s own
indispensible private secretary! And for what? No
vestige of a reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If she does report us, Prexy’s own indispensible
private secretary will take action,” threatened Lucy.
“I’d be the first person the president would ask
about it. If Miss Peyton went to see him in person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>I’d hear of it from him afterward; I’m sure.
If she wrote him, I’d see the letter and take the
answer he dictated. I’d ask him if I might tell you
girls about it, too.” The light of devotion shone
strongly in Lucy’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s Prexy? We’re not in awe of him with
our Luciferous on the job,” was Ronny’s confident
declaration. “Long may she flourish.” She held
up her glass of ginger ale. The others followed her
example, careful, however, to “Drink her down”
with repressed enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to be ashamed to face my classes tomorrow
with the sword of Miss Peyton’s disapproval
hanging over my head,” Kathie remarked in the
pleasant lull that followed the drinking of the toast
to Lucy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But are you?” quizzed Muriel. “I’m afraid from
your tone that you aren’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your fears are well grounded,” laughed Kathie.
“The sophs and freshies at the Hall, judging from
accounts, seem to be positively childish,” she continued
in a more serious way. “They’re not snobs
as the Sans were. There’s some hope for them. I’ll
venture to say that before next June Marvelous
Manager will have managed them.” Her prediction
was one of confident affection.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such a foolish name; and you will say it,” scolded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Marjorie and not quite in jest. “A fine manager
I am. I can’t even manage my own affairs. I can’t
decide whether to go home for Thanksgiving, or
stay here,” she added in self-derision.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One thing we <i>must</i> decide before we separate,”
Ronny said with energy. “Where shall we meet
tomorrow night? Remember we shall be twenty-nine
strong. We can’t hold the meeting in one of
our rooms. We must have plenty of space for our
new Travelers. The living room down stairs isn’t
private enough. Has anyone a really brilliant suggestion.
No other kind is desired. Save your
breath.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have. Hold the meeting in our library,” proposed
Lillian Wenderblatt. “I’ll put a sign on the
library door before dinner tomorrow night: ‘Professor
Wenderblatt: Keep Out,’ and lead Father to the
door to look at it. Then he won’t bolt into the
room with maybe two or three other professors in
the middle of our meeting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lillian’s proposal was received with approbation
and accepted with alacrity. Leila, Vera, Robin and
Lillian were chosen to notify the fortunate seniors of
the honor in store for them. The rest of the details
of the meeting were quickly arranged. Ten-thirty
was not far off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t imagine for a minute that you have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the last of your initiation,” Jerry informed Phil and
Barbara, a threatening gleam in her eye. “There
are still those two degrees, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, forget them. We shall,” Phil made untroubled
return.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may forget, but I—nevv-vur.” Jerry struck
an attitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor I.” Muriel dramatically tapped her chest
and glared at Phil. “’Sdeath to all quitters,” she
hissed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, glorious for my melodrama!” admired
Robin. “You and Jeremiah shall be the villains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I choose to be the principal, double-dyed scoundrel
of the show,” stipulated Muriel, “or else I’ll refuse
to see your play. I spurn anything and everything
but complete villainy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Give me a better part than Muriel or I won’t act,”
balked Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to fly before any more actors go on
a strike,” Robin raised a protesting hand. “I must
look out for Page and Dean’s melodramer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only birds, insects, aviators and ‘sich’ fly,”
criticized Phil. “I simply must get back at you for
not giving me a cousinly warning of what was in
store for me tonight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seniors, P. G.’s and faculty will add to the flying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>classification or lose what shreds of reputation for
integrity they have left,” laughed Kathie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An added word of warning:—Hotfoot it lightly.”
Jerry’s forceful if inelegant injunction sent the
initiation party down the hall dutifully smothering
their easily summoned mirth. Jerry accompanied
the party to the head of the stairs. She returned
to the room, keeping an alert watch as she walked
on a certain door across the hall. This time she
noted with satisfaction that it was tightly closed.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>JERRY SPEAKS HER MIND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“The ten-thirty rule will have to chase itself
merrily around the campus,” Jerry made airy disposition
of that time-honored regulation as she entered
the room which Marjorie was already beginning
to set to rights. With her usual energy the
stout girl gathered up the glasses, tucking them one
inside another and setting them in a compact row
at one end of the study table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I agree with you, Jeremiah. I have letters to
read that must be read, ten-thirty rule or no.” Marjorie
whisked an armful of crumpled paper napkins
and empty paper plates into the waste basket.
“There;” she cleared the table of crumbs; “that’ll
do for tonight. Thank goodness, all the eats were
eaten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can count on my fingers the times we’ve defied
old ten-thirty,” Jerry declared as she reached
in the table drawer for her two letters.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Ten times in four years,” Marjorie commented.
“That’s a good record.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True, Bean, true. When we stop to consider the
past—how wonderful we are!” Jerry simpered self-appreciatively
at Marjorie as she sat down under the
drop light with her letters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can I help but believe it when you say it
like that?” rallied Marjorie. “Anyway, you’re a
gem, Jeremiah. I was never more agreeably surprised
than when you turned the tables on Miss
Peyton tonight. I hadn’t noticed that their door
stood open. But you had, smart child. I had no
idea you’d been out in the hall on a tour of discovery.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I went directly after you were out there. I had
a hunch that the Ice Queen would start something.
So she did—through those two geese. They had that
room last year and didn’t appear to mind our occasional
soirees. But there’s still another and a chief
disturber—Leslie Cairns. She’s back of the Ice
Queen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think so, too,” Marjorie admitted with reluctance.
“I have seen them together several times.
Leslie Cairns has other friends on the campus, too.
Muriel and I saw her and Miss Monroe coming out
of Craig Hall this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You did?” Jerry showed surprise. “I’ll investigate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that. I may find out something interesting.
Miss Morris, that nice senior you’ve heard me speak
of, who came to the campus last fall from Vassar,
says there are only seniors and juniors at Craig Hall
this year. Perhaps it was the Ice Queen’s friends
she and Leslie Cairns were calling upon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may be,” Marjorie agreed. “I wonder if
Miss Monroe likes Leslie Cairns? Perhaps she
cares more about cars and expensive clothes and
spending money than anything else. We don’t know
her, so we can’t even guess what sort of girl she is
at heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know what will happen to her if she puts any
dependence in Leslie Cairns,” Jerry said grimly.
“Don’t waste your sympathy on her, Marjorie. She
isn’t worthy of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know why I feel so sorry about her, but
I do,” Marjorie confessed. “Whenever I see that
beautiful face of hers I forget she’s been so ungracious
to us. She’s not a namby-pamby kind of pretty
girl. She has a high, royal kind of beauty. I’ve not
given her up yet, Jeremiah. I’m going to try popularity
for her against Leslie Cairns’ money. I’m going
to put her in the first show we have. I’ll have
Robin ask her. I’ll stay in the background for
awhile.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nil desperandum,” Jerry encouraged with an indulgent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>grin. “Mignon La Salle reformed just to
please Marvelous Manager. Why not others? Besides
there’s always the pleasant possibility that the
Hob-goblin and the Ice Queen may squabble and
part.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So Muriel says. I mean about those two girls
disagreeing. You may make fun of me all you
please, Jerry. Just the same if we could win Miss
Monroe over to our side it would gradually put
everything straight here at the Hall. If Miss Monroe
became our friend, she would probably become
friends with the Bertram five. She’s friends already
with the other sophs and freshies here. Things which
are equal to the same thing are equal to each other,
you know. Leslie Cairns’ friendship cannot be beneficial
to her. I am sure of that. Yet to warn her
against Miss Cairns would be contemptible. Excuse
me, Jeremiah, for keeping you from your letters!”
Marjorie exclaimed in sudden contrition.
“It’ll be midnight before I’ve read all these.” She
flourished the handful of letters before Jerry’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go to it, or it may be morning. Why waste
precious time flaunting your letters in my face?
Why should your five to my two make you vainglorious?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s vainglorious?” Marjorie made a half
threatening move up from her chair. She dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>back again, laughing, as Jerry nimbly put the length
of the table between them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lots of people are vainglorious.” Jerry wisely
grew vague. “Don’t bother me, Bean. I hope to
read my letters in peace and quiet. Yes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>So do I</i>,” emphasized Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chums exchanged good-humored smiles, born
of perfect understanding and settled down to the
patiently deferred reading of their letters.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry read Helen’s letter first. She knew it would
be long and absorbing. Hal’s would be his usual
brief note. It was his weekly offering. Long since
Jerry had made him promise to write once a week
and had pledged herself to do the same by him. A
strong devotion lived between brother and sister
which had deepened year by year. Hal did not pretend
to understand Jerry from the standpoint of
girlhood. To him she was a good comrade; “the
squarest kid going.” Jerry was of the private belief
that she knew Hal better than he knew himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her one sorrowful concern in life was the knowledge
that Marjorie “couldn’t see old Hal for a
minute.” She would have tried to further Hal’s
unflourishing cause with Marjorie, but there seemed
to be no way of accomplishment. She knew only
too well Marjorie’s utter lack of sentimental interest
in Hal; her rooted aloofness to “love” as Hal had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>hoped she might experience it. “A regular stony
heart,” Jerry had secretly characterized her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry had shrewdly divined for herself the true
state of affairs between the two. Neither had ever
spoken intimately to her of the other. Nevertheless
when Marjorie had left Severn Beach for her midsummer
journey to Hamilton during the summer
previous, Jerry had been convinced that she had
“turned Hal down.” She had wondered then, and
since, how Marjorie could fail to love her big, handsome
brother—not because he had been devoted to
her since their first meeting—but for himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>The expression of good-natured amusement which
had visited her face during the reading of Helen’s
letter remained until she had read Hal’s note several
times. Then concern replaced it, making her round
face very solemn. She shot a covert glance at
Marjorie who was deep in Mary Raymond’s letter.
She had already devoured the contents of her
General’s and Captain’s letters. Both had been
comparatively short and loving inquiries as to
whether they might hope for her “gracious presence
at Castle Dean over Thanksgiving.” Neither superior
officer had made a point of asking her to
come home. Unselfishly, as ever, they deferred to
her judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had gulped down her rising emotions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>as she had read and realized afresh her father’s and
mother’s breadth of spirit. She had taken up Mary’s
letter, feeling that she must go home at all events
for the holiday. Mary had the long and astonishing
confidence to impart that she had fallen in love,
was engaged to be married the following September
and that her engagement was soon to be announced
at a formal luncheon to be given for her by her
mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Jerry!” Marjorie looked up brightly from
her letter. “Mary’s going to be married. I’ll tell
you all she writes about the great event while we
are getting ready for bed. I haven’t time now.”
Her hands were busy opening the letter from Constance
as she spoke. Again she dropped into silence
and the perusal of Connie’s letter. “Isn’t it too
bad?” she soon cried out. “Connie and Laurie are
not going to be in Sanford for Thanksgiving. Laurie
promised a composer friend of his to be present at
the first performance of his new opera ‘The Azure
Butterfly.’ He and Connie are going to New York.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That settles it for me. There’ll be one distinguished
mug missing on the campus. I’m going
home for Turkey Day.” Marjorie’s news concerning
Constance and Laurie had crystalized Jerry’s
wavering resolve to go to Sanford. “Poor old Hal!
A fine time he’d have with all of us away!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>A swift flood of crimson deepened the glow in
Marjorie’s cheeks; rose even to her white forehead.
She stared self-consciously at Jerry for an instant.
Without a word she laid down Connie’s letter and
took up the envelope addressed to her in Charlie
Stevens’ straggling hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>First exploration of its contents and she broke into
a low amused laugh: “Do listen to this, Jerry,”
she begged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry raised her eyes from Hal’s letter, at which
she had been soberly staring. She was provoked
with herself for having mentioned Hal to Marjorie
as an object for sympathy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Occupied with the letter from Charlie, Marjorie
did not notice Jerry’s gloomy features. Mirthfully
she read:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Marjorie</span>:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think your last letter to me was a dandy. I
read it twice and I was going to read it again only
I lost it. Maybe I lost it on the football ground or
in the street. But if anyone finds it they’ll see your
name on the end of it and guess that I am the right
Charlie it belongs to. Then I might get it again.
I know you won’t be mad cause I lost it. I couldn’t
help it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Connie is going to New York with Laurie for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Thanksgiving. She has to go because he is her husband.
We are very sorry. I don’t mean we are
sorry because Laurie is her husband but because they
are going away. The band is coming to our house
for a party on Thanksgiving evening. I am going
to play an awful hard piece on my fiddle that Father
Stevens composed just for me. You’d better come
home and then you can come to see us that night.
I like you, Marjorie, quite a bit better than Mary
Raymond. Connie says Mary is going to be married.
I used to say when I was real little that I was
going to marry her. I don’t say it now. I didn’t
know any better then.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope there will be snow and ice on Thanksgiving.
Will you go skating on the pond with me
if there is? I can skate fine and make a figure eight
and a double loop on the ice. Hal Macy took me
to the Sanford ice rink last Saturday afternoon.
He showed me how to make the figure eight. He
is a dandy fellow, only he doesn’t talk much. You
ought to see him play basket ball. He has all the
Sanford fellows beat. I like him because he always
goes around with the fellows and not the girls.
He thinks you are quite nice. I let him read your
letter before I lost it and he said I was a lucky kid.
I could write some more but I can’t think just what
to write. I will write some more some other time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>You had better come home soon. You and me and
Hal Macy will go skating. It is all right for you
to go with him. He would just as soon go any
place with you because he has been to your house
lots of times to parties and you have been to his
house and that’s the way it is. I have to go and
practice an hour on my fiddle so good-bye Marjorie
and I send you my love. Hurry up home.</p>

      <div class='line'>“From your best friend,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Good for that kid!” The cry of approbation
came straight from Jerry’s heart. “Old Hal has
had a lonesome time in Sanford for the past two
years. He could have gone into business for himself
in New York after he was graduated from college,
but he knew Father needed him in his business.”
Jerry checked herself with the reminder that
Hal would not wish her to glorify him, especially
to Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal is splendid.” Marjorie was always first to
give Hal his due, impersonally. “I know it has been
lonesome for him in Sanford without the old crowd
and—and—he must miss you so, Jerry,” she finished
rather lamely. She meant it in all earnestness. She
understood perfectly the bond between Hal and
Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Not half so much as I’m sure he misses you.”
Jerry grew bold for once. “This is what he has
written me. You can see for yourself what a good
sport he is.” She did not look at Marjorie as she
read:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jerry</span>:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yours of last week appreciated. You haven’t
yet said what you are going to do about Thanksgiving.
That I suppose will depend on the way matters
stand at Hamilton. If you don’t come home I
will keep Father and Mother busy looking after me
so they won’t miss you too much. Connie and
Laurie will be in New York over Thanksgiving so
I must cheer up Charlie by taking him to the football
game between the Riverside Giants and the Sanford
High team. I have been coaching the Sanford
fellows a little. It’s going to be some game. Hope
you’ll be on hand to see it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just remind Marjorie that I wrote her last. Tell
her she can square herself with me by coming home
for Thanksgiving. Connie told me yesterday she
had written to Marjorie. Hard lines to have Connie
and Laurie away on the grand old day. Better try
and see what you can do for me. With love. Good
night old kid.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Why, I don’t owe Hal a letter!” Marjorie regarded
Jerry in surprise. “He owes me one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He <i>does</i>?” Jerry showed more surprise than
had Marjorie. “Well, I believe both of you. It’s
a plain case of ‘all have won.’ Meanwhile where is
that latest glowing proof of a flourishing correspondence?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lost in the mail, perhaps,” Marjorie guessed.
She became silent for a moment. “I’m doubly sorry
about it. I shouldn’t care to have Hal think—”
Marjorie paused; looked away from Jerry’s keen
blue eyes, so like Hal’s, in confused embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know what to do.” Jerry kindly ignored
the embarrassed slip. “Go present him with your
regrets in person. I’ll give a hop, and invite you to
it. Won’t that be nice? Old Hal won’t care if
you are the only one invited.” She could not refrain
from a side-long glance at Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imagine Hal and me dancing solemnly around
your big ball room together, the only guests at your
hop.” Marjorie forced a laughing tone of raillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing would please him better,” Jerry stoutly
maintained. It was the nearest to an opinion concerning
Hal’s and Marjorie’s non-progressive love
affair that wary Jerry had ever ventured.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>TWO THINGS SHE KNEW ABOUT LOVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This time the blue and brown eyes met squarely.
Marjorie’s expression was a mixture of tolerance,
vexation and resignation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said it.” Jerry read the glance aright. “I’ll
say it for myself, too. Nothing would please <i>me</i>
better. You know the rest. It’s the first, last and
only appearance of Jeremiah as a buttinski. I knew
that someday, somehow, somewhere I’d say something
about you and Hal. ’Scuse me, Bean, ’scuse
me.” Jerry’s apology was half joking, half earnest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why—I—why—Jerry!” Marjorie stammered.
She grew rosy from white throat to the roots of
her curly hair. Concerning Hal’s avowal of love,
her captain had been her only confidant. Even Constance
did not know the circumstances of that bright
summer afternoon which she had spent with Hal
aboard the Oriole. “Why—Jurry-miar!” She used
Danny Seabrooke’s nickname for Jerry, with a rather
tremulous laugh. “Who—I never—”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Nope; of course not.” Jerry’s reply was comfortingly
positive. “Both you and Hal belong to
the high inner order of the tight-shell clam. I can
only guess how you stand with each other. I know
he loves you. Never think he told me that. I knew
it almost as soon as we first met you. It’s the same
true love, broadened and deepened, that he’s giving
you today. I wish you cared about him even one-half
as much as he cares about you. You’d be loving
him some. But I’m afraid you don’t. And
that’s flat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Jerry I don’t, and it is a relief to be able
to say it frankly to you.” Marjorie’s recent confusion
was clearing away. Her grave serenity of
tone robbed her candid confession of all harshness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve always hated to believe you didn’t for Hal’s
sake. I was pretty sure of it last summer at the
beach,” was Jerry’s sober answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m <i>never</i> going to marry, Jeremiah,” Marjorie
informed her room-mate with a kind of pessimistic
solemnity. “If I couldn’t love Hal enough to be
his wife, knowing how splendid he is, surely I
couldn’t marry any other man. Don’t think me
selfish because I put my work at Hamilton above
love. It is life to me—my highest, most complete
ideal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry surveyed her chum’s lovely, but very dignified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>features for an instant. She was divided between
a desire to admire Marjorie’s lofty purpose
in life and shake her soundly for her deliberate repudiation
of Hal and his warm true love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I’m not sorry you spoke to me of Hal. I’d
like you to know that—that we’re not betrothed—nor
never will be.” Marjorie’s voice dropped on the
last four words. “Only Captain and General know.
Not even Connie. I don’t think I have the right to
tell her. If Hal tells Laurie, he may ask Laurie to
tell Connie. I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know old Hal wouldn’t tell me.” Jerry’s
voiced conviction was emphatic. Jerry was more
disturbed than she then realized by the “wallop”
which Marjorie had managed to “hand” old Hal
somewhere along the road of time from the date
of Connie’s wedding. She was inwardly convinced
that the “turn-down” had come at the beach.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall tell him that I have told you, Jerry,”
Marjorie quietly announced. “It is Hal’s privilege
to tell Laurie and your father and mother. It was
mine to tell either you or Connie as my closest girl
friend. I have chosen to tell you. You are as dear
to me as Connie; but not dearer. Only—in this you
have the first right to know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie smiled very tenderly on Jerry. Her
plump, but not over-plump, partner in the journey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>through the land of college sat abstractedly scribbling
on the back of one of her envelopes, head bent
low. She was not far from tears. Jerry loathed
tears when, on rare occasions, she had been what
she termed “cry-baby” enough to shed them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Much obliged.” She now spoke gruffly to hide
her threatened flow of emotion. “I—I wish you felt
differently about Hal, Marjorie. I—I—always
looked forward to having you for my sister in that
way.” Jerry absently turned the envelope over and
continued to write on its under side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Jeremiah, you’re just as much my sister
now as you would be if I were—” Marjorie suddenly
checked her impulsive assurance. Her honest
nature compelled her to desist. No; it was not the
same. She knew that no declaration of sisterhood
to Jerry on her part could compare with the delight
which would be her chum’s were they to become
sisters through her marriage with Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not the same, Bean; not the same.” Jerry shook
a positive head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it isn’t. I knew it almost as soon as I
said it,” Marjorie admitted rather humbly. “I love
you a lot, Jerry. Most of all because you have always
loved me and wanted me for your sister. I’m
glad you spoke to me about Hal. There’s one thing
I can do for him. Go to Sanford and help you give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>him a jolly Thanksgiving. We owe it to him to
please him; more than we do to please the dormitory
girls. He’s the one most in need of good cheer this
Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha-a-a-a!” Jerry sat up very straight and drew
a long relieved breath. “You’re the best little sport,
Marjorie Dean! I was afraid you might not care
to see poor old Hallelujah on account of having
turned him down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sha’n’t mind seeing Hal,” Marjorie said slowly,
“for truly, Jerry, in my own way I like him as
well as ever. I haven’t changed toward Hal. My
attitude toward him is purely that of friendship.
But he has changed. We’re like two persons, standing
on opposite banks of a broad river, trying to
call across to each other. Neither of us can understand
the other. I wonder why true friendship can’t
content Hal. He wonders why I can’t understand
love.” She cast an almost mournful glance toward
Jerry which Jerry did not forget for many days
afterward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I only know two things surely about love,” Marjorie
continued after a brief silence. “One is that
I have never been in love. The other is that without
love no marriage can be happy. And now let’s
not talk of love any more, <i>ever again</i>, Jeremiah,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>she ended in a whimsical tone which made Jerry
smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right. Anything to please you, Bean,” she
replied. She was secretly elated over Marjorie’s decision
concerning Thanksgiving. Nothing could
please Hal more she was sure. “It’s midnight, anyway.
Time we put a curb on our talk fest.” She
rose to begin preparations for sleep. She would
have liked to assure Marjorie of how glad “old
Hal” would be, but had agreed to Marjorie’s taboo.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie gathered up her handful of letters from
the table, a contented little smile showing at the corners
of her red mouth. She was glad that she and
Jerry were going home; that the momentous decision
had been made. Picking up the last envelope
left on the table she saw it was not one of hers, but
Jerry’s. A fresh flood of scarlet flew to her cheeks
as she saw scribbled across the envelope in Jerry’s
hand: “Marjorie Dean Macy.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MEETING HER MATCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Why won’t you go to New York over Thanksgiving,
Leslie?” Doris Monroe’s accustomed indifferent
drawl quickened to longing exasperation, all
but ready to burst bounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t choose to,” came with laconic self-will
from Leslie Cairns. She cast an insolent, inquiring
glance toward Doris who was busy driving the
white car which Leslie had named the Dazzler and
loaned Doris for her own use. The pretty sophomore’s
injured expression brought a faintly mocking
smile to Leslie’s loose-lipped mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I know you don’t choose to,” declared Doris
in a purposely weary tone. She continued to keep
her eyes steadily on the road ahead. “<i>Why</i> don’t
you choose to?” she questioned, growing more
pointed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought to know without asking,” Leslie
grumbled. “You are just like Natalie Weyman, my
New York pal. You can’t remember, or be taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to remember, that business is business. Nat is as
crazy to have me go to the Weyman’s New York
house for Thanksgiving as you are to have me go
with you to New York. I can’t see either of you
when I have so much at stake here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon.” Doris turned politely chilling.
“I had no intention of breaking in upon yours
and Miss Weyman’s plans.” Her coolness arose
not from jealousy. Leslie’s rebuff had hurt her
pride. She had more than once suspected that Leslie’s
frequent allusions to “my pal, Nat,” were made
simply to arouse her jealousy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris was too comfortably wrapped up in self
to be jealous-hearted. She had a private conviction
that a girl who might prefer the friendship of another
girl above her own was of small consequence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Frowning, Leslie shot a second glance at Doris.
Her shrewd dark eyes read mainly in Doris’s lovely
blonde profile supreme discontent at not being able
to have her own way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You didn’t break into anything,” Leslie gruffly
assured. “That is what you and Nat Weyman seem
possessed to try to do, though.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean, Leslie?” Doris turned offended
eyes for a brief second on her companion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean you two seem determined to wreck the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>promising business career of Leslie Adoré Cairns,”
Leslie retorted with grim humor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Adoré!” Doris exclaimed irrelevantly. “What a
darling name!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just suits me, doesn’t it?” Leslie threw back her
head and indulged in her silent hob-goblin laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, it doesn’t,” Doris said with amazing candor;
“but it might.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” For once Leslie’s pet monosyllable
burst involuntarily from her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said it might suit you,” calmly returned Doris,
“if you would try to make it suit you. You’ve loads
of personality, Leslie; the kind that would make
people like you a lot if you cared to have them like
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not keen on having people like me, even if
I do happen to have a foolish middle name.” From
interest Leslie’s tone had quickly changed to one
of mild derision. “I mean I wouldn’t lift my finger
in order to stand well with a gang of girls. That’s
the way Bean made herself popular on the campus;
pretending to be so kind and helpful; setting up
goody-goody standards and poking her inquisitive
nose into a lot of things that didn’t concern her.
Then there was the Beauty contest. She won that.
It gave her a strong pull with the upper class girls.
All except the Sans.” Leslie’s displeasure against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Marjorie rose with the recital of past troubles.
“They <i>knew</i> the judges at the contest hadn’t played
fairly. Nat Weyman should have won the contest.
Wish you’d been a freshie that year. Bean wouldn’t
have had a look-in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I’m not so sure of that,” disagreed Doris,
with intent to be provoking. “Miss Dean is really
beautiful, Leslie. I’d hate to believe that she is more
beautiful than I. Sometimes I’m not sure but that
she is,” Doris gave a self-conscious, half rueful
laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What ails you?” Leslie demanded darkly. “I
thought you said you had no use for Bean and her
crowd. Look where you’re going. You almost
zipped us into that limousine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris’s honest, if reluctant, opinion of Marjorie
fanned the flame of Leslie’s too-ready ill humor.
She immediately vented it upon Doris’s driving.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>No</i>, I did <i>not</i> almost run the car into that limousine,”
was the other girl’s flat contradiction.
“What is the use in growing peevish with me, Leslie?
You know I detest Miss Dean and that Sanford
crowd. The only one of them who appears in
the least interesting is Miss Harding. She’s a barbarian,
but she has individuality. I can’t forget she’s
on earth, you know, since I have her as a room-mate.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>As she spoke Doris had slowed the speed of the
car for a stop before the Lotus, the tea room where
they had decided to go for a Saturday afternoon
luncheon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s a savage; so is Macy.” Leslie invariably
referred to Muriel and Jerry as “those two savages.”
“She’s clever, too, that Muriel Harding. The Sans
would have taken up with her and Macy and Lynde
when they came to Hamilton if they hadn’t been so
crazy about Bean. Macy’s father’s a millionaire
and Lynde’s father is a multi-million man. Harding
would have got across on her nerve. All three rallied
round the Bean standard and lost out with the
Sans.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was on Doris’s tongue to say: “Then they were
lucky, after all, since the Sans were expelled from
college.” Instead she held her peace. She intended
to try once more to coax Leslie to re-consider her
decision not to go to New York. Such a remark
from her now about the Sans would only stir Leslie
into fresh irritation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris sent a backward, lingering glance toward
the shining white car as the two girls started up the
wide cement walk to the tea room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t worry. It’ll be there when we come back,”
Leslie said with a half mollified smile. Doris’s proud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>anxiety concerning the white car was not lost on her.
It suited Leslie to pose as a benefactor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s such a dream,” sighed Doris. Her color
heightened; her blue eyes shone starry triumph of
the smart white roadster.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve engaged a Thanksgiving table already at the
Colonial,” Leslie announced, tucking her arm inside
one of Doris’s. “I tried to get one at Baretti’s
but the dago is sore at me. His tables are always
engaged beforehand if I happen to want one on a
holiday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Couldn’t we go to New York the day before
Thanksgiving and come back to Hamilton the day
after?” Doris once more pleaded. “You won’t
transact any business here on Thanksgiving Day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s what you say,” Leslie made instant rejoinder.
She laughed as though she was in possession
of a rich joke. “I’ve a special business stunt
to put over here on Thanksgiving Day. Get it
straight this time, Goldie. I am <i>not</i> going to New
York.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I shall go there alone.” Doris stopped on
the threshold of the Lotus. She faced Leslie angrily
as she made the stubborn announcement. For an
instant the two girls fairly glared at each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on inside, for goodness sake,” Leslie roughly
requested. She had turned incensed eyes from Doris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>in time to spy three Hamilton students coming up the
walk. Luckily their attention was focussed on the
white car. Two of them glanced back at it. It
was apparently the topic they were discussing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I meant what I said,” Doris began haughtily the
moment they had seated themselves at a table. “You
are so very queer. You seem to forget that I know
London and Paris. What is New York to me?”
Doris snapped contemptuous fingers. “Merely another
large city.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll find it a handful, if you try to tackle it all
by your lonesome,” was Leslie’s satiric prediction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t need, necessarily, to go there alone. I
know two sophs who would be glad—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forget it,” Leslie interrupted with a gesture of
dismissal. “The three of you would have nothing
on ‘Babes in the Wood,’ or any other of those lost
nursery kids. In New York, unless you’ve been
born and brought up there, you have to know the
right sort of people, or you can’t have a good time.
I could give you a letter of introduction to Nat
Weyman, if I wanted to, but it wouldn’t do. She’d
not like you, and you’d not like her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fail to understand why New York should be
so—so different from London and Paris.” Doris was
still haughty, though she was somewhat impressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>by what Leslie had just said. “I don’t wish to meet
Miss Weyman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Use your brain,” Leslie impatiently advised.
“London and Paris are like a couple of villages to
you because you know ’em. New York would be
a howling wilderness to you. Why? Because you
don’t know it. Simmer down, Goldie. I’ll take
you to New York with me the week after Christmas.
Our town house is closed this winter but I have an
apartment in New York and a chaperon whom I’ve
taught to mind her own business. You can help
me here a good deal on Thanksgiving Day by wearing
that new costume of yours that matches the
Dazzler. I want to make a splurge at the Colonial,
for reasons of my own.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course I wish to help you, Leslie.” Doris
was somewhat mollified by the Christmas prospect.
She flushed hotly at Leslie’s pointed reminder concerning
her new costume and the car. Leslie had
presented her with the white fur hat and coat, an
exquisite white silk gold-embroidered gown and
slippers and hose which made up the “costume.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then look pleasant, and listen to me,” Leslie
curtly directed, her eyes fixed on the other girl’s
rapidly clearing features. “Drive the Dazzler to
the Hamilton House for me at exactly eleven o’clock,
on Thanksgiving Day. We’ll go for a drive and stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>at the Colonial at two o’clock for dinner. After
dinner we’ll go for another drive. Then back to
supper at the Colonial. There’s a good movie theatre
in Hamilton. We might go to it in the evening.
You can easily run up to the campus and put the
car away before the ten-thirty bell rings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not go to Orchard Inn for supper instead
of the Colonial? Since there’s been so little snow the
roads are fine.” Doris made a last desperate effort
to have matters arranged partly as she wished.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too far away from the campus. My main idea
is to be seen with you in all your glory on Gobbler
Day. I shan’t tell you why. Don’t ask me. You’ve
said you wanted to help me. Prove it by doing just
as I tell you when I ask you to do something for
me.” Leslie leaned back in her chair and surveyed
Doris with the air of a dictator. She was giving a
faithful imitation of a favorite pose of her father.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well.” Doris relapsed into displeased
silence. She allowed Leslie to order the luncheon
and continued mute after the waitress had left them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie pretended not to notice Doris’s frigidity.
She busied herself with the menu, hunting a dessert
to her taste. When she had selected it she cast the
card on the table with impatient force.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t meet me at all Thanksgiving Day, if it
will be too much of a strain,” she sarcastically told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Doris. She knew that Doris was too deeply obligated
to her to make such a course of action probable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris viewed her with the cold, measuring glance
which Leslie had more than once privately admired
in Goldie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t mind meeting you and doing as you ask
me Thanksgiving Day, Leslie,” she said coolly.
“What I do mind is your dictatorial manner. And
sometimes you’re really insulting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can’t help it. That’s the way my father is,
and <i>that’s the way I’d rather be</i>. You said I could
make people like me if I tried. I wouldn’t try. I’d
rather have power; the kind that would make people
do as I said because they were afraid of me; afraid
to do anything different. That’s the kind my father
has. He’s a great financier. Of course his money
has helped him climb to where he is, but he has an
iron-strong will. His father left him a fortune,
but he’s made millions of dollars since then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s voice vibrated with melancholy pride as
she poured forth this praise of her father. She had
not told Doris of her estrangement from him, nor
did she purpose to tell her. She had long since arrived
at the conclusion that her father was not indifferent
to her welfare. Mrs. Gaylord had, in a
fit of confidence, admitted to Leslie that she had
been engaged by Mr. Cairns to chaperon her. Accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the two had come to amicable terms. Mrs.
Gaylord had amiably consented to go visiting among
her many friends and relatives a large share of the
time, thus leaving Leslie free to her own devices.
She had seen Leslie established in Hamilton at the
Hamilton House, had remained with her a week
and gone on to visit a friend with the usual understanding
that the receipt of a telegram from Leslie
would insure her immediate return.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should think you’d rather be in New York in
business so that your father could help you, since
he’s such a wonderful financier.” Doris’s practical
and wholly innocent observation raised the red of
embarrassment in Leslie’s dark face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My father is—” Leslie fought down the confusion
into which her companion’s remark had thrown
her. “Didn’t you hear me say our town house was
closed?” she asked grumpily. “My father’s in
Europe just now. Besides, this garage business
I’m in is to be a surprise for him. When he finds
I’ve made good he’ll be ready to let me into some
of his high finance deals.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s pet dream was re-instatement into her
father’s favor as a result of her own daring brilliancy
in business. Aside from the pleasure of
“making things hum for Bean” she thought well
of her garage project. It was the first step upward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in the business career she had set her heart upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s something I want you to do for me—not
later than tomorrow,” Leslie dictated, regardless
of Doris’s protest against her dictatorial manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it?” Doris again turned her measuring
glance upon Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want you to find out whether Bean’s going off
the campus for Thanksgiving. I must know. Find
out the same about Page, too.” Leslie’s rugged
features were set with dogged purpose. Her usually
loose lips were now formed into a tight line.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not certain I can find that out by tomorrow.
I may not be able to let you know before next
Tuesday,” Doris replied with dignity. “Miss Page’s
and Miss Dean’s friends are not mine,” she reminded
with irony.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That need make no difference. It’s important
to me to know.” Leslie tapped on the table with an
authoritative index finger in further emphasis of each
word. “You promised to help me, Goldie. Is this
the way you keep your promise? And with all I’ve
done for you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be so silly, Leslie. I’m not in the least
afraid of you. You can’t bully me even a tiny bit.
I told you I’d help you, and I will. But you must
allow me to use my own judgment in some things.
If that doesn’t please you, take back all you’ve given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>me. I can get along nicely without your further
help. I don’t fancy gifts that have strings attached
to them.” Doris elevated her chin to a haughty
angle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s face lost its tensity and registered half
a dozen varied expressions while Doris was announcing
her declaration of independence. At the last a
look of glum perplexity replaced the others. While
she had been leader of the Sans at Hamilton she had
had many altercations with her chums. She had
never taken their angry protests against her tyranny
seriously. No one of them had actually defied her
except Dulcie Vale, and she had “begun” on Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Face to face with a girl who coolly ordered her
not to be “silly,” and declined to be bound by obligation
further than she chose Leslie had received the
surprise of her life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me know as soon as you can. Phone me at
the hotel and I’ll meet you.” The dessert she had
ordered, untouched, Leslie rose from her chair. She
had determined to show Doris that she was deeply
offended.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without saying good-bye she stalked sulkily from
the tea room. On her way to the door she demanded
the check from the waitress and stopped at the desk
to pay it. She half hoped Doris would hurry after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>her and beg her to go back. Instead Doris sat tranquilly
at the table Leslie had quitted and enjoyed
her dessert of Nesselrode pudding. For once Leslie
had met her match.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>“Truly, Robin, it is so selfish in me to be going
home and leaving so much for you to do.” Marjorie
surveyed Robin Page with a troubled, conscience-stricken
air indicative of her feelings.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, shucks!” exclaimed Robin blithely as she
glanced up at Marjorie from a list she was busily
compiling. “Go home to Castle Dean and forget for
four days that Hamilton is on the map. Don’t be
so conceited. We can get along beautifully without
you,” she teased. “Phil, Anna Towne, Barbara and
I are a splendiferous combination. You’ll hardly
be missed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t doubt that.” A good-humored smile
touched Marjorie’s rosy lips. “I know things will
run along on wheels. What I’m thinking of is the
amount of extra effort your splendiferous combination
will have to make. You see I’m taking with
me not only the Sanfordites but Leila, Vera and
Kathie as well. That leaves you and Lillian, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>only original Travelers to keep the new Nineteen
Travelers going and manage the different stunts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Most of the stunts we’ve planned will manage
themselves,” was Robin’s confident assurance. “Remember
they are already planned and you did a
large share of the planning. So you see you haven’t
been so much of a quitter as you seem to think.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a perfect partner, Page,” Marjorie looked
heart-felt appreciation of the charming, boyish-faced
girl who had never failed her since the two
had joined forces for democracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Glad you like me, Dean.” Robin answered the
look with her bright, piquant smile. It amused the
two to address each other occasionally by their
family names. “Listen now while I read you the
program I’ve jotted down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go ahead.” Marjorie hurriedly finished strapping
the suitcase she had just packed and seated
herself in a chair to listen.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Wednesday morning. She and Robin had
respectively cut chemistry and philology for the purpose
of completing the Thanksgiving program to be
carried out on the campus during Marjorie’s and her
chums’ absence by Robin, with the assistance of
Barbara Severn, Phyllis Moore and Anne Towne,
leader of the dormitory girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tonight we’ve left free to the students to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>up their own jollifications,” Robin proceeded. “Most
of the girls in the campus houses have spreads,
dinners, etc., planned for this evening. The dormitory
girls, as you know, are going to take in
that illustrated lecture on the South Sea Islands
at the Hamilton Theatre. Tomorrow morning there
is to be a special service in chapel. I’m going to
sing a solo. So is Blanche Scott.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” Marjorie cried out in delight. “You never
told me Blanche Scott was coming to Hamilton.
How I’d love to see her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll see her when you come back,” Robin assured.
“I’ve been keeping her coming as a surprise
for you. She’s going to be at Silverton Hall for
two or three weeks after Thanksgiving. She promised
me this visit last summer. She’s to be married
in April, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I received her betrothal announcement and that
of one of my oldest Sanford chums on the same day
last summer. My Sanford chum, Irma Linton, is
to be married at Easter time. She is the girl who
I used to tell you Elaine Hunter was like,” commented
Marjorie. “Blanche and Elaine two loyal
Silvertonites now on the road to matrimony,” she
added musingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; and Portia Graham is a third. She won’t
care if <i>you</i> know it, Marvelous Manager. She’s engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>to a doctor. She ’fessed up in one of her
latest letters to me. But this isn’t on our regular
program.” Robin again fell to consulting the list
she had written.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Next comes the dinner at Baretti’s for the dormitory
girls. He hasn’t told us yet what it will
cost, but—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, goodness!” Marjorie bobbed up from her
chair with the suddenness of a jack-in-the-box. “I
had so much to talk over with you I almost forgot
to show you Signor Baretti’s note. It came this
morning.” She glanced anxiously toward the wall
clock. “He wants to see us at twelve today.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder why?” Robin appeared a trifle
startled. “I hope our Thanksgiving dinner arrangement
with him isn’t going to flivver.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He won’t fail us, I’m sure. Very likely it’s the
cost of the dinner he wishes to discuss with us.
Such a funny little note.” She produced the
Italian’s letter from the top of her chiffonier and
handed it to Robin. The latter read aloud with
amused emphasis:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Dean:</span></p>

<p class='c006'>“You pleas come to my restaurant at twelva the
clock befor afernoon on Wenesda. you tell Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Page come to. I am not smart to write much.
you please come here I tell you evrythin.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your frien,</div>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Guiseppe Baretti.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“All right, Guiseppe, we’ll be there at twelve,”
smiled Robin as she returned the letter to Marjorie.
“I’ll go over the rest of this now, in a
hurry. This will be our only chance. We’ll bump
into all our friends, once we’re out on the campus.
Any of them we don’t happen to meet there will
probably appear at the inn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too true, Page; too true.” Marjorie agreed
with a rueful shake of her curly head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Phil has managed to get up a basket ball game
for Thanksgiving afternoon between two picked
teams, regardless of class. It’s to be held in the
gym, beginning at three-thirty. She has had her
hands full, making up the right sort of teams.
Gussie Forbes is going to play center on one team.
Miss Walker is to play center on the other team.
What do you think of that?” Robin cast an inquiring
look at Marjorie. She added, without
waiting for answer. “Phil had to arrange matters
so in fairness to Miss Walker. She is as fine a
player as Gus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Phil is the goddess of fair play.” Warm admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>for invincible Phil lighted Marjorie’s features.
“It will do Gussie and Miss Walker good
to be pitted against each other. Each may discover
something to admire in the other before the game
ends. It was a bold stroke; but exactly like Phil
to do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She says it will turn out for the best. Here we
are stopping to talk again. Hm-m-m!” Robin importantly
cleared her throat and went on. “The
dormitory girls are going to be hostesses at a dance
in the gym on Thanksgiving night. You know all
about that, so I won’t have to stop to explain. The
rest of this list is made up of the stunts we’ve already
planned. As soon as we’ve seen Baretti I’m
going to hurry to Silverton Hall and letter a large
card of announcement to put in the main bulletin
board.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie and Robin had been planning for two
weeks a series of amusements to be given during
the holiday for the benefit of the students left on
the campus. There were to be paper chases and
outdoor gypsyings on Friday and Saturday if the
weather was fine. The Travelers, nineteen, new,
and two, original, were to divide themselves into
seven groups, three in a group, and head the various
picnickings to be held at different points of the
country surrounding Hamilton College. Campfires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>were to be built for the purpose of roasting eggs,
potatoes and chestnuts. Bacon and marshmallows
were to be toasted over the flames on sticks, and
coffee was to be made, the favorite campfire elixir
the world over.</p>

<p class='c005'>In case of a storm-bound Friday and Saturday
a variety of campus-house amusements would take
the place of the outdoor jaunts. Each campus house
contingent had pledged itself to get up an impromptu
entertainment on short notice, if needed,
for the amusement of its own household and that
of the off-campus students. Robin and Phil had
arranged a concert for Friday evening in the gymnasium
at which to introduce a number of talented
girls who had been shyly lingering in the background.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saturday evening there was to be an old-fashioned
costume party in the gymnasium to which
the whole college was invited. While the weather
had been moderately cold with brisk winds and no
snow the Travelers had plans made for coasting
and skating fun should a swift freezing change accompanied
by enough snow visit the campus.</p>

<p class='c005'>It has taken diplomatic work to enlist the campus
houses in the entertainment campaign. There was a
certain amount of ill-feeling in all of them toward
the post graduates. This was the result largely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of the two sophomore factions whose idols were
respectively Doris Monroe and Augusta Forbes.
Only the double fact that they could not go home
for Thanksgiving and the inborn love of girlhood
to get up shows and “be in things” made Marjorie’s
and Robin’s plans possible. Even haughty
Doris Monroe was looking complacently forward
to playing the leading part in a sketch which no
less person than gloomy-visaged Miss Peyton had
written.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ronny had quietly taken upon herself the furnishing
of the orchestra and a buffet collation of
sweets, fruit punch and ices for the dormitory girls’
dance. The old-fashioned hop on Saturday evening
was a half-dollar donation party, for the benefit
of the Hamilton poor families. Phil’s own
orchestra would furnish the music. There would
be fruit lemonade only by way of refreshment. The
admission fee was to be dropped into a box with
a slitted cover as the guests entered the ball room.
The box was to be in charge of a maid of long ago.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it befell that Marjorie discovered the very
opportunity for which she had been waiting. Doris
Monroe, attired in a sleeveless, high-waisted gown
of baby blue, her golden hair massed high on her
lovely head would constitute a perfect custodian of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the precious box. After due consultation Page and
Dean decided that Lillian Wenderblatt should be
chosen to tackle the delicate task of asking the
haughty sophomore to deign to make herself useful
at the hop.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve certainly done good work on that
Thanksgiving program,” Robin congratulated as
the two girls presently left Wayland Hall to make
their call upon Baretti. “The best part of it is we’ve
provided entertainment for either good weather or
bad. We’re becoming invincible. Nothing can stop
Page and Dean from ‘carrying on.’” She laughed
at her own jesting conceit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie smiled in sympathy of Robin’s optimistic
view. “It looks to me as though it might rain
before night,” she predicted, scanning the gray
masses of clouds beginning to roll up in the west.
“I hope those clouds mean snow instead of rain.
It’s hardly cold enough for snow. Anything but a
rainy Thanksgiving! Thanks to <i>you</i>, Robin Page,
we can discount the rain on the campus, if it should
come. You’ve done a good deal more than I on
the program. And see how I’m going to leave you
in the lurch,” she added lightly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve <i>not</i> done more on the program than you,
and your presence will hang over the campus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>whether you’re here or not,” Robin said with positiveness.
“In time to come the Page part of the firm
of Page and Dean may be forgotten, but the Dean
part; never.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A FRIEND INDEED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was precisely noon when the partners entered
the inn. The somber beauty of the great
square room always seemed to Marjorie to be more
like a continuation of Hamilton Arms than a restaurant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are here on the time, Miss Dean, Miss
Page.” The friendly Italian proprietor of the inn
had been watching for them. He trotted forward,
his hand outstretched. “I write you the letter,
then I afraid mebbe you go home early thisa morn.
You don’t get it. Then think, no—you don’t go
home when you give the dorm girls the dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am going home, Signor Baretti, but Miss Page
is going to remain on the campus. Several of the
girls with whom you see us generally are going
home, too. Miss Moore and Miss Severn are to
help Miss Page with the Thanksgiving dinner for
the dormitory girls.” Marjorie smiled her regard
for the kindly little man as she made this explanation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Ah, yes;” nodded the Italian. “Now you sit
down; have the lunch with me. It is ready; very
special; all for you.” He conducted them to one
of the tables and bowed them into their chairs.
“You are please have the lunch with such a nobody
Italiano?” he asked jokingly. There was, however
a touch of embarrassment in the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The instant warm affirmative from his guests
seemed to delight him immensely. He signaled to
the Italian waitress who had been hovering near
waiting for his order. She nodded and hurried
from the room returning quickly with the soup.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now I tell you,” he said as they began the soup.
“You know I like the dorm you build. I give this
dorm a good present someday when I see what the
dorm need much. I know you want give the college
young ladies who used live where the dorm is
the good time. I know they don’t have the mona;
not much.” He pursed his lips and shook his head
in regret of the dormitory girls’ moneyless estate.
“You are the ones to make these happa, because
you do good for these. I am this to make them
happa, too. They don’t pay for the Thanksigivin’
dinner. You don’t pay. I give the dorm girls the
dinner. Then I am happa. It will be the fine
dinner. You do this for me. You tell the dorm
young ladies come to the dinner at one. I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>close my restaurant, but I have only enough tables
for the dorm girls. I have already tell those freshmans,
sophmans and studen’s they can reserve the
tables only after half past two of the clock. They
come here before, they must sit on the benches an’
watch the dorms eat.” His eyes twinkled humorously
as he sketched this dire prospect for the girls
who were pluming themselves upon having reserved
tables at Baretti’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie and Robin could not refrain from laughing
at his revelation. They could picture the rows
of exclusive but certain-to-be-very-hungry girls
meekly sitting watching the dormitory girls eat up
the turkey for which they were yearning. The pure
democracy of the Italian’s plan robbed them both
temporarily of ready acknowledgment of his generosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know what to say. I’m simply flabbergasted!”
Robin finally exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t like?” The little man glanced anxiously
from one girl to the other. “I don’t un’erstan’
that word flab—flab—.” He gave a half puzzled,
half smiling shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed we do like your plan. By flabbergasted
I mean that I am so surprised and delighted. I’ll
say the word slowly for you.” Robin pronounced
it by syllables.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“So-o-o. I listen.” He made Robin say it over
several times. “It is a long word. I like the long
words in American.” He repeated the word until
he appeared to know it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had a shrewd suspicion that he had
seized upon the strange word as a means of hiding
his embarrassment at his own generosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What you think, Miss Dean?” He suddenly
fixed a pair of penetrating black eyes upon her.
“You like, too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like your plan? I should say I did.” Marjorie
bent her friendliest smile upon the devoted adherent
of the dormitory cause.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You couldn’t do anything that would bring more
happiness to the off-campus girls, Signor Baretti,”
Robin told him. “They will feel so proud and
happy to be invited by you to a private Thanksgiving
dinner. But you mustn’t forget the campus
girls. You know your restaurant is the Hamilton
girls’ favorite tea room. I simply have to put in
a good word for them, too,” she ended loyally.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes; I un’erstan.’ I know what you mean,”
the Italian assured. “Oo-oo, many nice studen’s
come here, don’t go another tea shop. All the rest
of the day after half past two is for them. My
ten tables are all reserve for after the dorm dinner.
In my restaurant I can put more tables. That is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>no good. Some studen’s come here I don’t like.
They eat here same time as dorm girls maybe they
make the trouble. Miss Car-rins ask me for the
Thanksgivin’ table. I don’t give her one.” He
waved a prohibitive finger in the air. “She can start
the trouble from nothin’. You know now she lives
in the town?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, we know it,” Marjorie’s response came in
even tones. “Her business interests keep her in
Hamilton, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her business is too much to mind the business
of others.” A fleeting scowl passed over the Italian’s
forehead. It lingered between his brows as he said
resentfully: “Once this Miss Car-rins say about me
when she is here in this room but verra mad at
me: ‘Let the dago have his hash house. I hope it
burn down tonight.’ Never-r-r I forget that. I
feel to say to her when she come here again after
long while: ‘You don’t come here more.’ I cannot.
This is the inn; for everybody who want come
who behave quiet. But never-r-r I let her have the
special table. Naw!” The inn keeper put great
stress upon this resentful resolve.</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither Marjorie nor Robin hardly knew what to
say. They had long since heard the story Baretti
had just told them from Vera.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t take anything Leslie Cairns said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>heart, or ever let it worry me for a minute, Signor
Baretti,” Marjorie finally said in soothing tones.
She recognized the Italian’s right to comforting
words. She knew he could not forgive having
been called a “dago.” Far more humiliating it
must then be to his pride to have heard his beloved
restaurant dubbed a “hash house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think mebbe I don’t,” Baretti decided, his
brooding features brightening again. “Anyway I
don’t have Miss Car-rins here when are the dorm
girls here. She might act verra mean. So some
freshmans and sophmans who have the tables here
will act mean, too. Miss Car-rins don’t like those
who have no much mona. If she come here with
the pretty girl who have the proud face and the hair
of gold I don’t say nothin’. She can sty unless she
makes the fun of me. She shall no do that. It is
my hash house.” He threw back his head and
laughed. “In it I can do the way I please. So
Miss Car-rins come here someday, make the fun
of me again, I walk up to her, take her by the arm,
very quiet, and make her to walk out the door.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Thanksgiving Day dawned without the tiniest
streak of sunlight to grace it. Early in the morning
heavily overcasted clouds began emptying their
cold dispiriting torrents of rain upon a brown and
soggy earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Safe within the cheerful walls of Castle Dean
Marjorie’s delight in being at home was dampened
by the thought of how Robin Page and her volunteer
entertainment committee were battling against such
a dreary day. She could only hope that the steady
persistency of the Sanford downpour was not repeating
itself at Hamilton. True she and Robin
had planned their program to cover that possible
calamity. Bad weather could not fail to make it
harder for Robin, Phil and Barbara to keep things
moving with the energy and smoothness so necessary
as a means toward uniting the interests and
the sympathies of the students of the various campus
houses with those of the dormitory girls.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>While Marjorie, Leila, Vera and Jerry were
cosily ensconced in the Deans’ living room lamenting
over the bad weather, Robin Page, Phil Moore
and Barbara Severn were holding a serious consultation
of three in Robin’s room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s after ten o’clock now Phil,” Robin was saying.
“Really, I think I’d better brave the rain, go
over to the garage and run Vera’s car into town.
Anna said yesterday that there were only two busses
running on the new bus line. There were three,
but one has been taken away to another route.
Seventy-two girls will crowd two busses. Suppose
anything should happen to either of the two? I
told Anna to get the crowd to the inn by half past
twelve. It will take longer to run out from town
in the pouring rain. We mustn’t be a minute late
at the inn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m very well aware of that, sweet coz,” Phil
returned in her bantering fashion. “Far be it from
me to allow the gang to be late and disarrange the
well-laid plans of Guiseppe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you intend to paddle out in this deluge and
play duck, count me in,” Barbara made valiant announcement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t lose me, either,” Phil decided.
“Slave, bring me my raincoat, my faithful Tam and
my goloshes! Out in the tempest I must go!” She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>struck a dramatic posture, held it a moment, then
said disappointedly: “I fail to see anyone around
here who answers to the name of slave. I’ll have to
be it myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later the three, with raincoats buttoned
to the chin, caps drawn low, high-buckled
goloshes on their feet, the largest umbrellas they
could find over their heads, were plodding through
the rain to the garage which housed Vera’s car.
The latter had urged Robin to make use of it during
her absence. Leila’s, unfortunately, was laid up for
repairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some of the dormitory girls were going to walk
to the campus today. Just imagine!” Phil said
ironically to Barbara. The two, seated in the tonneau
of the car, watched the drenched landscape
through the half-opened curtains as the machine
fled along the pike.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wade would be more appropriate,” laughed
Barbara. “But they’ve changed their minds long
before now. Deliver me from any more walks in
this flood. I don’t envy Robin her job of chauffeur.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re making good time.” Phil inspected her
wrist watch with a satisfied nod. “We ought to be
at the place on Linden Avenue where the busses
make their stand by ten minutes past eleven. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>time are the dormitory girls to be at the stand?”
She leaned forward and called out her question in
Robin’s ear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Half past eleven,” Robin raised her voice above
the beat of the pelting rain, but did not turn her
head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll have to mob the corner drug store nearest
the stand. They can’t stay out on the walk with
the rain coming down in cataracts,” commented
Phil. “Anna Towne can be depended upon to have
them at the bus stand on time. Such a horrible
flivver for a holiday! I don’t dare stop to think
of it,” she grumbled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her guess regarding their speedy arrival at the
bus stand was an accurate one. It was precisely ten
minutes past eleven when Robin brought the car to
a stop before the drug store. The rain was still
driving down in misty sheets as the trio emerged
from the automobile and made a frantic dash across
the sidewalk to the shelter of the drug store. Immediately
afterward Anna Towne and half a dozen
of her intimate friends arrived, radiant-faced in
spite of the storm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This <i>is</i> a surprise,” Anna greeted. She shook
hands with the three hardy Travelers as though it
had been a long time instead of only yesterday
since she had seen them. “The rest of the crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>will soon be here. I managed to telephone all of
them this morning to be at the stand at eleven-fifteen
instead of eleven-thirty. Then we’ll surely
be ready to start at exactly eleven-thirty. The bus
drivers are so disobliging. They are hired specially
to bring us to and from the campus yet they never
want to wait a second beyond a certain time for us
to assemble. They’re not supposed to carry any
passengers but us during those trips. But they do.
I say this, not by way of complaining, Robin, I object
to their unfairness. A great difference between
those Italians and Signor Baretti, isn’t there? I
think he is wonderfully kind to remember the off-campus
girls in such a generous way.” Anna’s pale,
interesting face brightened with appreciation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Signor Baretti has true college spirit,” Robin
returned with conviction. “I can’t imagine those
two grumpy bus drivers as imbued with any such
noble quality; or that Italian, Sabani, the man
they work for. If those two kickers show any signs
of grouchiness this morning I shall read them a
Thanksgiving lecture. It won’t be the kind to feel
thankful for, either. By the way, where are they?
I ordered them to be here at eleven and stay here
until told to start for the inn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Involuntarily the group of girls moved nearer
one of the huge plate-glass show windows to peer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>bright-eyed, into the rain-swept street. As far as
they could see, up and down the street, there were
no signs of the large dark red busses with their
flashy yellow trimmings.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s eighteen minutes past eleven,” Phil’s tones
conveyed her consternation. “Where <i>can</i> those aggravating
busses be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not where they should be,” scolded Robin. “Here
comes a big crowd of the girls. The busses should
be here so that they could step directly into them.
They’ll have to come into the drug store instead.
Maybe the druggist will object to sheltering us.
There’ll be enough dripping umbrellas to flood the
store. Oh, dear what a mess! Why did it have to
go and rain on Thanksgiving Day? And where, oh,
where, are those miserable drivers and their
busses?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Mindful of past liberal patronage of the Hamilton
College girl and with a shrewed eye to the
future the druggist himself ushered the arriving
party of merry girls into the store and obligingly
supplied a couple of large packing boxes in which
to stand the dripping umbrellas. Despite Robin’s
despairing opinion that the store would not hold the
umbrella-laden brigade they managed to crowd
into it.</p>

<p class='c005'>By eleven-thirty the last girl had arrived at the
rendezvous. They were a cheery, light-hearted,
buoyant company regardless of their cramped quarters.
Their appreciation of Signor Baretti’s invitation
to be his guests at a Thanksgiving dinner
showed itself in their bright faces, spontaneous
laughter and gay holiday air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s one minute past eleven-thirty, and no busses.
I’m going to find out what is the matter.” Robin
made the low-toned announcement to Phil and Barbara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>with an air of desperation. “I’m going to
’phone Sabini’s garage where the busses are kept.
I can’t imagine what can have happened to make
them late. I wish you two would keep a sharp
lookout for them. If they should come while I
am ’phoning you can hurry back to the ’phone booth
and let me know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose they shouldn’t come. What then?” Barbara
regarded Robin with lively apprehension.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t ask me.” Robin raised a hand as though
to ward off such a catastrophe. “Let’s not suppose
anything quite so harrowing,” she added in a more
hopeful tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later she emerged hastily from the
telephone booth. Her expression was one of acute
dismay. She made hurried way, in and out among
the crowded company of girls, to where Phil and
Barbara were anxiously keeping up a watch at one
of the big front windows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One of the busses has broken down!” she cried
excitedly. “The other bus is out somewhere. The
man at the garage who answered me doesn’t know
where. I tried to hire cars from the garage. There
are <i>none</i> to be had. How are we going to land the
dormitory girls at Baretti’s by one? And we can’t
ask Signor Baretti to serve the dinner later!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What an <i>awful</i> state of affairs!” Barbara echoed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Robin’s consternation. “We’ll have to do something
very suddenly to offset it. What about hiring
the station taxicabs; all of them, if we can get them.”
was her quick suggestion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We might do that,” Phil hailed the idea eagerly.
“There are five or six of them. With our car and
Lillian Wenderblatt’s we could carry the gang to
the inn at one trip. Go ahead, Robin, and ’phone
Mariani’s garage. I’ll ’phone Lillian.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a wonder and a comfort to my distracted
old age, Phil.” Robin showed grateful relief.
“Watch me start on the trail of those taxies.
Never mind the expense.” She darted back to the
telephone booth she had recently left. Phil followed
her; slipped into an adjoining booth and
proceeded to call Lillian Wenderblatt on the telephone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the waiting company of girls a loud buzz
of dismayed conversation had now risen concerning
the non-appearance of the busses. Anna Towne,
Florence Wyatt and Marian Barth, seniors and
members of the new Travelers’ sorority, were
anxiously discussing the situation with a group of
their particular friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>At least a third of the off-campus students who
had lived in the old houses, which had been
demolished to make place for the dormitory, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>in process of building, were seniors. While they,
with the students of the lower classes, had been
familiarly termed by the Travelers among themselves
as the “dormitory girls,” they hardly hoped
to have the pleasure of living even a few weeks in
the dormitory before their graduation from college.
Far from being disappointed at this prospect they
did not stop to consider themselves but showed only
the utmost satisfaction in the good fortune which
would fall to the other two-thirds of the off-campus
contingent.</p>

<p class='c005'>In themselves the dormitory girls were the finest
student element at Hamilton. Originally brought
together, and gradually welded into a congenial,
self-governing body by the efforts of Marjorie,
Robin and the Travelers, these earnest, capable girls
were daily living up to the Hymn to Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>As president of the senior class sunny-faced, easy-going
Phil Moore was their idol, Barbara, as her
chum and intrepid co-worker, was hardly less worshiped.
The moment Barbara left Phil to make her
way back to the window she was eagerly surrounded
and plied with concerned questions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t give up this ship, children,” she gaily
declared, raising her voice above the flood of questions
which assailed her. “Robin is ’phoning for
taxies from the station and Phil is ’phoning for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Miss Wenderblatt and her car. We shall manage
O. K. without the busses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Barbara’s assurances were received with jubilant
cries of acclamation from the effervescently happy
girls. While she was in the midst of them she happened
to glance toward the back of the store. Phil
was just emerging from the ’phone booth a pleased
smile on her face. She paused before the booth
which held Robin and peered in through the glass
panel. Robin was still busy ’phoning, it appeared.
Phil turned, saw Barbara looking toward her and
waved a re-assuring hand. It signified that her
part of the telephoning had been successful.</p>

<p class='c005'>A false alarm of: “Here comes a bus!” caused a
surging of the crowd to the window. Through the
rain a large dark red milk truck had been mistaken
for one of the busses. When Barbara finally
turned away from the window it was to find Phil
and Robin beside her. Phil was no longer smiling.
Her blue eyes were full of resentment. Robin’s
face was a mixture of dismay, indignation and
perplexity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you think?” she blazed forth to Barbara.
“That miserable Mariani person won’t let us
have a single taxi! He claims they are all in use
and will be the rest of the day. He was so hateful
to me. He asked me very sarcastically why we did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>not use the busses today since we used them every
other day instead of his taxicabs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We certainly are in a pickle. Uh-h-h.” Barbara
simulated collapse. “I’d forgotten all about
it, but someone told me long ago that those two
Italians, Mariani and Sabani have been at daggers
drawn for years. Sabani once had the station jitneys,
and all to himself. Then came Tony Mariani
with a better looking lot of cars, and ran Sabani
out. Then Sabani built a garage and ran that, but
he swore never to accommodate anyone who patronized
Mariani. The bus line belongs to Sabani. I
suppose he has registered the same vow against
Mariani.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we might as well count them both out,”
was Robin’s dispirited ultimatum. “Did you ever
know worse luck? To have all our plans upset because
a couple of Italianos are ready to swear a
vendetta!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If only we could capture a truck. I’d drive it
myself,” Phil valiantly declared. “But it’s a holiday,”
she added with a hopeless shrug of her
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That milk truck is the only one I’ve seen today,”
said Barbara mournfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to deliver the guests to Baretti in
private cars,” was Robin’s undaunted decision.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Thus far we have two; ours, and Lillian’s is likely
to be here any minute. I’ll start at once with
seven girls. You two stay here and start Lillian’s
car back with seven more the instant she comes.
It’s twelve o’clock now. We have exactly one
hour. Phone Gussie Forbes and Calista Wilmot.
They both have cars. They will help us out. So
will Laura Mead and Norma Buchanan. I almost
forgot our new Travelers. If those four girls can
make one trip apiece, each taking seven or eight
girls to a car, Lillian and I can make a trip and a
half apiece in an hour. We simply must.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To think was to act with Robin. She had hardly
finished sketching her plan to her chums before she
had begun to marshal seven of the dormitory girls
to the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Follow me,” she laughingly directed. “I’m going
to make a rapid sprint for my car. You do the
same. Never mind your umbrellas. You’ve not
time to hunt them out now. I’ll bring them to the
campus later in the car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Across the walk she dashed, an intrepid little
leader, and opened the door of the car nearest to
her. Her followers, close at her heels, merrily
stowed themselves into the automobile. A moment
or two and Robin was in the seat and had started
the car.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The palm-screened window of a florist’s shop
across the street afforded an excellent view of Robin
and her party of girls to an interested spectator.
Leslie Cairns had gone to the pains of donning
leather coat, knickers, rubber hood and high-laced
boots, and actually walking in the downpour from
the Hamilton House to the florist’s shop opposite
the bus stand. Her idea was not that of taking a
rainy-day constitutional. Leslie had posted herself
behind the barrier of leafy green for the express
purpose of watching the working out of a little plan
of her own.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE WILL AND THE WAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>While Phil hastily telephoned Wayland Hall
and sent out her emergency call for Gussie and
Calista, Barbara busied herself with getting into
communication with Laura Mead and Norma Buchanan
of Silverton Hall. Anna Towne had been
posted to watch at the window for Lillian. The
latter arrived shortly after Robin had gone. She
quickly took on her load of passengers and whizzed
off as speedily as she had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arrived at the inn with her first installment of
guests, Robin found Signor Baretti a most sympathetic
listener to the report of the calamity which
had overtaken the off-campus girls. Mindful of the
fact that the nationality of the two warring garage
proprietors was the same as Baretti’s she made her
report a strictly impersonal one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is no way for Mariani an’ Sabani to do.
Verra bad,” was the little proprietor’s wrathful
criticism of his countrymen. “I know these verra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>well. They are the Italianos. But they are not
much good. They are too craza get the money.
Each steal the business of the other. To get mad
at the people; that is the verra bad business. The
people don’t ride, Sabani an’ Mariani get no mona.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was very bad business for us,” Robin assured
him with a rueful smile. “I think now that we’ll
be able to bring the girls to the inn almost on time.
We can’t avoid being a little late.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t speak of that. It is the all right,”
protested Baretti.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you so much, Signor Baretti. But we
<i>must not</i> delay your Thanksgiving arrangements.”
Robin made a movement as though about to depart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You listen one minute.” Up went one of the
Italian’s hands for attention. “You don’t worry
about nothin’, Miss Page. Your frien’s come pretty
soon in the cars with the dorm girls. The dinner
is a little late, I don’t care. These frien’s who have
the cars take the dorm girls to town, to the campus,
all the day when they need to go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, the same girls will help us if they haven’t
any special engagements for the afternoon and
evening. The dormitory girls are to see the basket
ball game in the gym this afternoon. Then they
have to go to town to get ready for a dance in
the gym this evening. After the dance they must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>be taken back to town again. We don’t wish to
disappoint them if we can help it.” A worried
pucker appeared on Robin’s white forehead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know what I do.” Baretti treated Robin to
a brilliantly encouraging smile. She had never before
seen him look so utterly genial. “You wait—you
see.” He nodded at her mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve done so much for us already,” she demurred,
answering the smile with her own charming
one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do more,” he promised heartily. He trotted
along at her side as she hurried to the door, repeatedly
assuring her of his help.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin had sprung hastily into her car and headed
it for the town of Hamilton when Lillian Wenderblatt
drove up with a second load of girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurray! Never say die!” Lillian hailed triumphantly.
“We’re here, because we’re here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The girls in the car took up the cry and shouted
it joyfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You made quick time,” Robin said to Lillian
with grateful warmth. “Gussie, Calista, Laura
Mead and Norma Buchanan have been phoned for.
Phil and Barbara are at that end of the job. Did
you meet any of our rescue motorists on the way?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; I passed Gus and Calista not far from the
Arms. They were speeding along, splashing up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>water like sixty. They were having a race to see
which one could keep in the lead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank goodness for such glorious news!” exclaimed
Robin energetically. “Do you mind making
another trip, Lillian?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d love to. I’ll dump my cargo of dorms, as
our friend Guiseppe likes to call ’em, instanter.
Then I’ll beat you back to town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no you won’t. Good-bye. I haven’t time
to say much obliged.” Robin promptly started her
car and sped away through the fine misting rain into
which the heavier downpour had at last merged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is one way to spend Thanksgiving,” she
reflected, a touch of mockery in her smile, as she
sent the car ahead at the highest speed she dared
employ. “I know three Silvertonites who are going
to be away late for dinner at the Hall, too.
But it’s our traditional obligation to see the dorms
within Baretti’s hospitable gates first and consider
our own turkey dinner last. Just the same I hope
there’ll be lots of turkey left. I’m so hungry.”
Robin sighed audibly.</p>

<p class='c005'>She forgot her hunger when she suddenly spied
Gussie and Calista coming up, a pair of highly enthusiastic,
if somewhat reckless chauffeurs, each
driving a car filled with dinner guests.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can always rely on the Bertram Taxi Company,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Gussie called at top voice. She was in the
lead and radiant with the opportunity which had
fallen to her to make herself useful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin rewarded Gussie with a gay salute. “Seen
the others?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Laura and Norma? Met them just as we turned
out of Linden Avenue,” the reply floated back to
Robin’s gratified ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>When within a short distance of the bus stand
she had the good luck to encounter Laura and Norma.
They had enthusiastically hailed the detail as
a fine opportunity to prove <i>their</i> mettle as Travelers.
They had also pressed Adeline Raymond,
another of the new Travelers, into service with her
car. Twenty-six passengers made up the jubilant
aggregation of the three cars which the trio of
Travelers had brought to the emergency.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin shouted and waved her encouragement of
the overflowing carloads of girls as the machines
shot past her own. She did not attempt to stop
the three willing drivers who had responded so
promptly to the call. She had not more than reached
the drug store and sprung from her car when Lillian
drove up, laughingly sounding her own praises
as a high-speed motorist.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have met the obstacle and surmounted it,”
Phil emphasized her joyful boast with a flourish of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the arm. She and Barbara had rushed out of the
drug store at sight of the returned pair of P. G.’s.
“Only sixteen more girls to go to the inn. Speed
up, and you can get them there by a little after one.
Then you can come back for us. I’ve ’phoned Silverton
Hall that we may be late for dinner. It will
be all right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a collection of jewels, all of you.” Robin
made an affectionately inclusive gesture. “What
about Thanksgiving dinner at your house, Lillian?”
she turned to her classmate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not until four o’clock. I’ve barrels of time to
squander,” Lillian declared extravagantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on, friends and fellow-citizens!” Robin
was now beckoning briskly to the sixteen girls of
the dormitory group who had followed Phil and
Barbara outside the store. “Please accept my profound
apologies for having to pack you in, eight
to a car. It will have to be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Try to regard the experience from the stoical
standpoint of a sardine,” Phil advised comfortingly,
but in a comfortless tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her advice was received with a buzz of retaliating
sallies from the giggling aspirants for sardine
experience. Neither dark weather nor mishaps can
long suppress the exuberant spirit of youth. It
bubbles up like a magic spring at the first intimation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of trouble ended and good fortune nigh. What
might have been a most vexatious disappointment
had been averted in the nick of time. In consequence,
Baretti’s dinner guests were in high feather
at the triumph of Robin, Phil and Barbara over
calamitous circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin’s heart responded to the rollicking happy
disturbance the double octette of girls were making
as they piled themselves into the two waiting cars.
She did not know what the rest of the day might
bring forth but she was greatly inspirited by Signor
Baretti’s promise to help.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must hurry away again, Signor Baretti. I
must go back to town for Miss Moore and Miss
Severn,” Robin explained a little later to the Italian
as she saw the last of the dormitory girls ushered
high and dry into the inn. “I’ll stop here on my
return trip with the girls’ umbrellas. They’ll need
them when they are ready to go over on the campus.
I don’t believe it will ever stop raining.” Standing
in the open door of the inn she made a grimace of
mock despair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It rain, oh, way late tonight, mebbe,” prophesied
Baretti. “I have look at the sky verra hard.
Well, it is not that much to be sad to me if I have
not many more than the dorm girls for the dinner.
After the dinner, Pedro, my man, stay here at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>restaurant. I am the one to go to the town and see
Sabani. I know him. I speak the verra cross
words to him. He knows how I can be verra mad.
I make him send the busses to the campus after the
<i>ginnasio</i> for the dorm girls.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN UNEXPECTED SHOWER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It seemed to Robin as though the road between
Baretti’s and the town of Hamilton was never ending.
While she and Marjorie counted the odd little
inn-keeper as their friend and a sincere advocate
of the dormitory project, she was amazed at this
latest proffer of friendship. She had little doubt
as to what would be the result of his call upon Sabani,
a fat, taciturn fellow with a surly, hang-dog
manner. Among the sprinkling of Italians who
lived in or near the town of Hamilton, Guiseppe
Baretti was held in the light of an uncrowned monarch
by his humbler countrymen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Baretti’s,” as his restaurant was familiarly
called, had been for years the favorite rendezvous
of the students of Hamilton College. Like the inn,
its silent, keen-eyed proprietor had found lasting
favor with the campus dwellers. From faculty to
freshmen the little man was known and liked. His
interest in the Travelers and their ambitious plans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>for a free dormitory had been awakened on the
evening when Marjorie, Robin, Phil and a group
of their boon companions had, in a spirit of mischief,
serenaded him. Since that memorable evening,
when he had entertained them with a story
of his own miseries as an emigrant in New York
City, his interest in their work and accomplishment
had grown greater. The Travelers now numbered
him as one of their staunchest allies.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At last!” Robin exclaimed half aloud as the
familiar turn into Linden Avenue appeared, only
a few rods ahead. She sent the car fleeing down
the wet avenue, bent on reaching the drug store at
the earliest moment. She had hardly begun slowing
down as the car neared the store when Phil and
Barbara issued from it and ran down to the edge
of the walk to meet her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You made dandy time,” Phil called out. “Are
you sure you weren’t speeding?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seemed as though I’d never reach here,”
Robin declared. “I spun the car along as fast as
I dared. I’ve come for you and the girls’ umbrellas.”
Robin hopped agilely from the car and landed
on the walk between Phil and Barbara. “We
must start back in about three minutes. We’ll be
late for dinner, but not too late. I’m famished. I
left Lillian at the inn, starving. She’s saving her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>appetite for Thanksgiving dinner at home, and it
won’t be served until four o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three promoters of happiness swung gaily
up the walk, oblivious to the drizzling rain, entered
the store and made an energetic onslaught upon
the two make-shift racks of damp umbrellas. With
the help of the proprietor and a ball of heavy twine
the umbrellas were made into several bundles and
deposited on the floor of the car. Barbara volunteered
to keep them company on the back seat of
the machine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may sit on the front seat, Phil. You’ve
something to tell Robin. I resign the place of honor
in favor of you. I am too considerate to join the
front seat party by sitting on you. I’m going to
roost among the bumbershoots.” Barbara climbed
in among the piles of umbrellas and settled herself
cosily on the back seat, her feet tucked under her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Roosting among the bumbershoots,” laughed
Phil. “That sounds almost scientific; as though the
bumbershoots might be a species of rare bird, or
maybe a savage tribe. Oh, but it’s good to be on
the move again.” She straightened in the seat and
drew a deep breath of satisfaction. “Those two
hours of watchful waiting that Barbara and I put
in will last us for a long time to come. Weary
watchful waiters waitfully watching the weather.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>We weren’t the only waitful watchers, either.”
Phil’s merry tones gave place to a more forceful
accent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean, Phil?” Robin cast a quick,
side-long glance toward her cousin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leslie Cairns was across the street in the florist’s
shop watching us. She was standing at the
back of the window that had the palms in it. She
had on a leather motor coat with a hood. The hood
was drawn over her head and she wore knickers and
high-laced boots. She looked more like an aviator
than a motorist. I happened to get a good view of
her. Most of the time she kept out of sight behind
the palms. I think she was there for a purpose,”
was Phil’s distrustful surmise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, she may only have happened in the shop,
either to order flowers or to hunt shelter from the
rain,” Robin made charitable allowance. “Very
likely she has a dinner date with Miss Monroe or
one of the Acasia House girls. What possible interest
could she have in the dormitory girls? You
know what a snob she used to be. I daresay she
hasn’t changed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has nerve,” grumbled Phil who had always
detested Leslie Cairns with the full strength of her
democratic soul. “If I had been expelled from
Hamilton, even unjustly, I’d never set foot on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>campus again. The idea of trying to gain a social
footing on Hamilton campus after the hateful way
she fought against everything fair, honest and ennobling!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin, busy guiding the car through the thin,
gray mist, nodded her sympathy of Phil’s impulsive
outburst. “Did you see her leave the florist’s shop,”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; just before you came back this last time.
She dodged out of the store like a streak, jumped
into a little black car she’d parked in front of the
shop, and away she drove like the wind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hm-m. That sounds rather suspicious. She
may have had some dark and desperate motive.”
Robin was half smiling. “More likely she simply
happened to go into the shop, saw the crowd across
the street and curiosity got the better of her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t think so,” Phil frowned and shook a
doubting head. “She had an object in view. She
isn’t half so much interested in getting ready to
build a garage on that property she snatched from
you and Marjorie as she might be. I believe she
bought it purely for spite; as an excuse to keep her
near the campus. She’s rich in her own right, and
a law unto herself. It’s the old story of idle hands
and mischief. She has no worthy object in life.
She’s the kind of person who has to have something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to hammer away at. So she’s settled herself near
the campus to see what she can do to tear down
what Page and Dean have built up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Phil’s voice rang out resentfully on the last sentence.
She had felt suspicion rise within her the
instant she caught sight of Leslie Cairns. “There!”
she declared with some vehemence. “I’ve told you
plainly what I think of Leslie Cairns. You know
I’ve never said much about her before now. I don’t
mean to be a back-biter. But I think she’s more
likely to try to make mischief now than ever. She’s
vindictive. She’s shown that. She likes to blame
Marjorie, instead of herself, for the trouble she
and the Sans had that wound up their B. A. prospects
at Hamilton. I won’t forgive her for misjudging
Marjorie purposely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t blame you, old firecracker. I sympathize
with your sputters,” laughed Robin. “I’ve said
as much as you about Leslie Cairns to Marjorie.
It’s just as Marvelous Manager says. We can’t
judge her on suspicion. If she should make us
trouble, later, all we could do would be repair the
damage done and go on minding our own affairs.
No one can punish Leslie Cairns so effectively as
Leslie Cairns herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True enough, wise Robin.” Phil’s sunny smile
broke from behind her briefly clouded features.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Let’s leave her to her own downfall,” she said
lightly, “and consider instead our Thanksgiving
thankfulnesses. I’m thankful the weather’s growing
better instead of worse, and doubly thankful we
decided to go to town and engineer the dinner movement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Without us the girls might have had hard work
reaching the inn,” Robin asserted. “They couldn’t
have walked and look presentable after they
reached Baretti’s, and they would not have been
able to hire any cars. They’d have <i>had</i> to telephone
us, but they might have tried to help themselves
first. That would have taken time, and been
a failure in the end. By the time we had gone to
their rescue it would have been late in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We managed to dodge a fine flivver all around,”
observed Phil with a self-congratulatory nod.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under Robin’s slender practiced hands the car
had been swiftly eating up the distance between
town and the inn. The cousins hardly realized
their nearness to it, so earnestly were they talking,
until the quaint low structure appeared ahead of
them, only a few rods distant, a welcome sight.
Robin slowed down with a deep breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You almost anchored our good ship Bubble in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>a mud hole, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” teased Barbara. She
scrambled from the tonneau, balanced herself on
the running board and nimbly leaped the shallow
beginning of a deep, wide roadside puddle, the
greater spread of which was in front of the car.
Barbara flapped her arms and made a triumphant
landing on wet but solid ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one is infallible,” chuckled Robin. “Thank
your stars I didn’t splash you. It’s your move, lady.
Don’t be afraid to make it,” she turned to Phil
with the gruff tone of a traffic officer. She and Phil
both rose in the seat to leave the machine. Both
beheld in the same instant a small black car coming
toward them at high speed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Swish; splatter; splash! The forward tires of the
oncoming car struck the wide puddle with a force
that sent the muddy water of the puddle upward in
jets. In passing Robin’s car the other machine
gave a violent lurch toward it that threatened but
did not precipitate a collision. On down the road
the black car shot, spattering the mud and water
high as it whizzed out of sight around a bend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whew! Faugh!” Phil dashed away a splash of
soft mud that had struck her squarely on the mouth.
Face and clothing were liberally spattered with it.
Robin had been equally unfortunate. Phil suddenly
burst out laughing. “Oh, ha, ha!” she laughed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“My poor polka dot cousin. You’re a P. D., Robin;
instead of a P. G.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop laughing,” ordered Robin, herself giggling
immoderately at the disaster which had overtaken
them. “Your face looks even worse than mine. And
bouncing Bab escaped just in time. That last
bounce saved you,” she told grinning Barbara.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did I tell you only a little while ago?”
Phil glanced up the pike in the direction in which
the devastating car had disappeared. “She saw us
before we saw her. She put on speed and did that
stunt simply to be malicious. If we’d been half a
second sooner in getting out of the car we might
have had the most wonderful mud shower bath!
She took the risk of smashing into our machine
for the pleasure of spattering us. She’s vindictive—just
as I said.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leslie Cairns’ own variety of sport.” Barbara
now hurried to where the two victims of Leslie
Cairns’ ill nature stood wiping the thin oozy mud
from their “polka dot” faces. “You should have
seen the expression of her face as her car zipped
by ours. She looked delighted—a wicked, hateful
kind of delight. No wonder Muriel and Jerry call
her the Hob-goblin!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I crowed too soon. A mud-splashing is something
we didn’t dodge,” Phil said ruefully. “I feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as though I had been swimming in the mud. Come
on, Barbara Severn, and get busy with these umbrellas.
I can order you about. You’re only a
senior. Help from P. G.’s will also be appreciated.
I’m tired and hungry and muddy. Ah, there stands
the guardian angel of Hamilton!” Phil waved a
gay hand to Signor Baretti who had just appeared
in the doorway of the inn.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little man responded to the wave. Then he
disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared. He
returned at once with one of his olive-skinned
kitchen helpers and proceeded to busy himself with
the care of the umbrellas.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll let the men carry the bumbershoots inside.
If we go in there we’ll not get away from the crowd
for awhile,” Phil predicted cannily. “Remember our
own Thanksgiving feed. Meanwhile I am starving
to death by inches.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re not going inside, Signor Baretti,” Robin
told the smiling “guardian angel” as the helper disappeared
with the last of the umbrellas.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know,” the little man bobbed his head understandingly.
“I know you are in the hurry. I don’t
see you till is done in the <i>ginnasio</i> the ball game
you have tell me about. You say it is done, mebbe
five the clock. I go there. Wait for you. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>I meet you I have for you the bus, the taxi—something
to ride in for the dorm girls. Now I don’t
know which these. But I find out.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE REASON WHY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Marjorie Dean; dear old Marvelous Manager!
I’m <i>so</i> glad you’ve come back to the campus.
I feel like squealing for joy. I was never
before quite so glad to see anyone!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie, first off the train of her party, walked
straight into Robin Page’s welcoming, outstretched
arms. The Sanford-bound party had left the campus
under rain-threatening skies. They were returning
to find Marjorie’s first Hamilton friend
decorated with a carpet of soft cold white. On Saturday
the weather had grown colder. Sunday afternoon
had brought a mild snow storm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gracious; you must have missed me! This is
surely a cordial reception, Pagie dear.” Marjorie
laughed her pleasure of re-union as she warmly returned
Robin’s hearty embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have; <i>I have</i>,” Robin’s tones rose in a mild
wail. “Oh, you lucky gang,” she cried, surveying
fondly the eight returned Travelers. “I drove your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>car down tonight, Vera. Leila’s hasn’t come home
from the repair shop yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Robin kept up a lively chatter as she was passed
from one to another of the octette. Her extreme
charm of face and manner made her place in the
hearts of the little coterie of friends a very individual
one. A less sensible girl than Robin might
easily have been spoiled by the knowledge of her
peculiar power to charm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Phil and Barbara ought to be here, too.” Robin
made a searching survey of the white, drifted platform
with her eyes. “They started out to see if
they could beg, borrow or steal a car. They wanted
to come with me, but I told them to go and hunt
a car of their own. I said: ‘When you find it you
may bring it to me,’” laughed Robin. “I knew we’d
need two cars. I didn’t care to call a station taxi.
Wait till you hear my reason for cutting out those
same taxies.” Robin’s delicate face hardened a
trifle. “It’s a very good——”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sharp little shout of welcome broke in upon
what Robin was saying. Phil, Barbara and Gussie
Forbes suddenly appeared on the platform. Phil
and Barbara were escorting Gussie with a great
show of respect. Each had her by an arm. Both
were endeavoring to look dignified. Gussie was
frankly giggling her enjoyment of the situation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“Captured a soph; tallest in captivity; absolutely
primitive; untamed, probably belongs to the cave
dwellers union,” recited Phil, indicating Gussie with
an enthusiastic flourish. “She may even be a Celt.”
Phil arched significant brows at Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May she, indeed?” Leila pretended deep surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You heard me say she <i>might</i> be,” Phil retorted
grandly. “Anyway, she has a car that’s not in the
repair shop. That’s more important this evening
than being a Celt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now where is the one who told you that?” Leila
glared about her, as if determined to hunt out the
offender.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mustn’t be <i>too</i> personal.” Phil put her
hand to her lips. Shielding them cup-fashion she
said in a loud whisper: “Keep quiet. She mustn’t
suspect the reason we invited her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I doubt if she ever finds out,” was Leila’s satirical
assurance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor, benighted soph.” Vera turned a pitying
look on the primitive, untamed soph who returned
it with a bold wink.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She seems to understand a few things,” Muriel
made equally sarcastic comment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll guarantee not to ditch the car, even if I do
have an untamed air,” chuckled Gussie. “Come on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Travelers. No place like home when home’s a good
place. Six to a car. Come, choose your east. Come,
choose your west.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Travelers obeyed the call, laughingly dividing
themselves into two groups. Robin, Marjorie,
Muriel, Phil, Lucy and Vera took possession of
Vera’s car. Leila, Jerry, Kathie, Barbara, Ronny
and Gussie fell to Gussie’s big high-powered touring
car. They were all in an uproariously merry
mood as their frequent peals of laughter went to
testify.</p>

<p class='c005'>Phil magnanimously volunteered to forego the
delights of re-union and drive the car so that Robin
could tell the girls the campus news. Lucy elected
to ride on the front seat beside her. “Such a noble
act deserves the reward of my company. Besides,
I’ll hear the same news later. There’ll be at least
half a dozen editions of it,” she slyly prophesied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie’s first eager question: “How did everything
go?” set Robin off on an account of the calamity
that had overtaken the dormitory girls on
Thanksgiving morning. She had just reached the
point in her narrative where she and Barbara and
Phil had piled the umbrellas belonging to the dormitory
girls into the automobile and started for the
inn when Phil brought the car up in front of Wayland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Hall and called out in stentorian tones: “All
out. Step lively.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll have to tell you the rest when we are settled
again up in Marjorie’s room. This is the Tragedy
of Page minus Dean, in two acts. Wait till you
hear the sensational climax of Act One,” Robin
animatedly informed the absorbed listeners.</p>

<p class='c005'>The brightness of reunion had been gradually
fading from Marjorie’s face as she listened to Robin
to give place to an expression of almost stern gravity.
Robin had not yet brought Leslie Cairns into
the narrative. Nevertheless her name had suddenly
leaped into Marjorie’s mind. Why Robin’s recital
of her difficulties with two warring Italian garage
owners should have reminded Marjorie of Leslie
Cairns she was momentarily at a loss to understand.
She conceived a swift, unbidden, formless
suspicion of Leslie which she instantly tried to dismiss
as unworthy. It continued to tantalize her
brain until she recalled with relief that it was the
mention of the Italians as garage owners that had
brought Leslie to the fore in her mind. Leslie herself
was a prospective garage owner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later when Robin had resumed her
story to her interested audience of chums Marjorie
sat, chin on hand, staring in secret bewilderment at
Robin as the latter indignantly recounted the sensational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>mud-spattering climax of Act One, with
Leslie Cairns as the villain. Her curious, flitting
suspicion of Leslie had not then been idle. She
felt as she might have if she had suddenly reached
up and picked her conviction of Leslie’s treachery
out of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Phil insisted from the first that Leslie Cairns
had an object in view when she stood in the store
watching us from behind the palms. I tried to give
her the benefit of the doubt. Afterward, when she
<i>deliberately ran her car through that mud puddle
as hard as she could drive it, and as close to our
car as she dared</i>, I decided Phil was right,” Robin
asserted with an energetic bob of her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you think her object was, Phil? Leslie
Cairns’, I mean?” Vera voiced the curiosity of
the others. “Do you think she heard about the dinner
to the off-campus girls from her friends?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course. She must have. Hard to say what
her object may have been. She was probably hunting
mischief. When she couldn’t find any to do, it
put her in a worse humor than ever with us and
she vented her spite in a mud-spattering act.” Phil
accompanied her opinion with a contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That ends the first act, ladies and Gentleman
Gus,” announced Robin. “The second act has nothing
to do with Leslie Cairns. It features Guiseppe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Baretti, the hero of the hour and the knightly defender
of the dormitory girls.” She accompanied
the announcement with flamboyant gestures.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you for special mention.” Gussie stood
up and bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re welcome,” beamed Robin. “I couldn’t
resist including you. It sounded well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a poor way to do, to be calling attention to
oneself in the middle of a story,” grumbled Leila.
“My fine old Irish manners tell me that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ask them to tell you to practice the lost art of
silence,” Muriel blandly requested. “When you get
the information pass it on to Gentleman Gus.
Whisper it so we can’t hear it. We’re anxious to
hear the rest of Robin’s tale.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but you have an idea you are talking!”
Leila exclaimed with withering sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Taisez-vous.</i>” Robin shook a playfully threatening
finger at the merry gabblers. “I’ll resume before
you have time to interrupt me again. After
Phil, Barbara and I got our mud shower we hustled
to Silverton Hall. We were late for dinner;
awfully late, but everybody was good to us and the
dinner was splendiferous. We started for the gym
the minute we had finished dinner. Gussie, you can
tell the crowd about the game afterward. I want
to keep to the subject of my own troubles as a promoter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>minus a partner. It was a great game. I’ll
say that much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gentleman Gus is the best player I ever saw
tackle a game,” Phil praised. “That’s all. ’Scuse
me for interrupting.” She cast a comical glance at
Robin, who returned it with a reproving one, then
continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“When the game was over I went outside the
gym wondering if Signor Baretti really had been
able to reduce those provoking Italians to reason.
He was waiting just outside the double doors. I
know by the way he smiled that he had found some
way of helping us. He told me he had managed
to make Mariani let him have four taxies and that
he had his own large car and a smaller one he used
when making hurried business trips. I still had
Vera’s car. We had come over from Silverton Hall
in it. His big car would easily hold ten passengers,
by having the taxies make a second trip all the off-campus
girls would be taken care of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mariani himself was driving one of the taxies.
You should have seen the expression on his fat face!
He was so peeved at Baretti he didn’t know which
way to look!” Phil interposed, laughing at the memory
of the miffed Italian’s grouchy face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Baretti had the machines lined up on the branch
drive east of the gym. I asked him if the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>could be depended to bring the girls back to the
campus after supper and come for them after the
dance. He said: ‘Yes-s, I tell again. Then sure.’”
Robin imitated the inn-keeper briefly. “He marched
up to the first, then the others, and said about six
words to each; except Mariani. He and Guiseppe
had quite an argument. I could tell by the way they
wagged their heads and shrugged their shoulders
and made gestures to go with almost every word
they said. Finally Signor Baretti came over to me
and said very proudly that it was all right; to tell
the ‘dorm’ girls to get into the machines. Just about
that time——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We came along with our little chug wagons,”
broke in Gussie mischievously. “That’s all. Don’t
forget to give us credit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t worry. I never forget,” recklessly boasted
Robin. “Yes; Gentleman Gus, Calista, Norma
and Laura came along again with their cars and
the taxies didn’t have to make a second trip. Lillian
couldn’t come. Their dinner was so late. Besides
they were entertaining at her home in the
evening. Mariani furnished the same four taxies
out to the campus in the evening at the usual rate.
After the dance he only sent two, and the drivers
said they couldn’t come back. I was positively green
with rage. I tried to catch Mariani on the ’phone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>but he wouldn’t answer. The girls helped out again
and we managed to land the last ‘dorm’ on her own
doorstep a little after midnight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you tell Guiseppe of Mariani’s second flivver?”
Vera asked. “If you haven’t, you’d better.
He will wish to know it. He’ll think you haven’t
much confidence in him if you don’t let him know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was too late to bother him that night, and I
was so busy Friday and Saturday I didn’t have
time to go and see him. I intend to tell him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did the busses run again on Friday? Are they
running now?” were Marjorie’s questions, uttered
in quick succession.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, <i>sir</i>; they aren’t running yet. And Mariani
isn’t giving good service. I know of a number of
different girls who have since then ’phoned for
taxies, and have had no service. Whenever they’ve
called on the ’phone about it, no one at Mariani’s
garage has seemed to know anything,” Barbara finished
disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did Signor Baretti say about the busses
not running? Did he find out what the trouble
was?” Again it was Marjorie who questioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He hadn’t found out the reason when he came
to the gym after the game on Thursday. He said
he would, though. I know he will. He is the never-give-up
kind. When he does find out we’ll hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>from him.” Robin said this with the utmost confidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, may a poor, timid Irish woman ask
a question?” Leila had been listening to Robin, an
inscrutable smile touching her red lips. Her bright
blue eyes were alive with a cold sparkle which Jerry
had once declared looked like fire behind ice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do ask it.” Jerry had instantly marked the expression.
She straightened in her chair, the picture
of expectation. Leila was about to say something
startling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I will.” Leila flashed Jerry a knowing
smile. “What has Leslie Cairns to do with the second
act of the Tragedy of Page minus Dean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now you have asked a question.” Ronny’s gray
eyes gleamed shrewdly as she brought out the crisp
commendation. “When we fit an answer to that
very leading question we’ll probably know why the
busses stopped running.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A QUEER JOKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Leila’s frank assumption that Leslie Cairns had
been a secret Thanksgiving Day disturber could not
fail to find lodgment in the minds of the girls gathered
in Marjorie’s room that snowy Sunday afternoon.
There was not one among them who did not
know considerable about Leslie Cairns’ underhanded
methods of trouble-making. They knew,
too, that she had oftenest directed her spite against
Marjorie. Marjorie was adored for her beauty, as
Leslie was disliked for her lack of it. Her unfair
treacherous ways made her unprepossessing features
even more ugly in their girlish eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Be it said to their credit they tried not to discuss
Leslie any more personally than could be helped
under the circumstances. All of them were of the
same opinion. Leslie had not gotten over her grudge
against Marjorie. She had chosen to strike at a
time when she knew Marjorie would not be on the
campus to guard her benevolent interests.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“She’s as relentless as an Indian,” was Jerry’s
opinion of the ex-student. “It’s a good thing for
Bean that she has me to protect her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie did not take the indignant view of Leslie
Cairns’ further attempt to persecute her which
her comrades entertained. Still she was now more
concerned about it within herself than she had been
in her earlier campus days when Commencement
was a far-distant prospect. Now she was a promoter.
She smiled to herself whenever the word
crossed her brain. She was a promoter of democracy;
a promoter of happiness. Before she had
gone through the gate of Commencement she feared
that she had been far more interested in <i>her</i> welfare
than she had that of others. Now her work
demanded the thought of others above her personal
wishes and inclinations. It became more than ever
necessary that she should make it her business to
guard the interests of those who would benefit by
and through the efforts of Page and Dean.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Between you and me,” she said confidentially
to Jerry the next afternoon in the privacy of their
room. “I wish Leslie Cairns would go on an expedition
to Alaska, Kamchatka, Bolivia, Tasmania or
any other far away point where she’d be neither
seen nor even heard of for a long time.” Marjorie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>tone was anything but vindictive. Her brown eyes
regarded Jerry somberly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your wish and your tone don’t harmonize,”
criticized Jerry. “Why wish your worst enemy almost
off the face of the earth in such a mournful
tone? Which shall I believe?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Either or neither. Suit yourself,” Marjorie
stood before the mirror of her dressing table adjusting
a chic little green velvet hat to just the right
angle on her curly head. The hat placed to her
satisfaction she swung round from the mirror saying
forcefully, “It makes me weary, Jerry, even to
have to think of Leslie Cairns. She isn’t my worst
enemy. She’s her own. I wish someone could
make her understand that. But not I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who?” Jerry looked up in mock alarm from
the translation into French which she was in indifferent
process of making. “I hope you didn’t mean
me, Bean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not you.” Marjorie’s merry laugh was
heard. “I don’t know who. I won’t allow myself
to label Leslie Cairns as dangerous. In the past
she usually overreached herself every time she
started trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are living in the present, Bean,” Jerry
staidly corrected, “and Les, as her pals used to call
her, is living in our village, too, and right on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>job. She’s like an epidemic. No one knows how
or when she may break out. Things were whizzing
along on wheels when we went home at Thanksgiving.
Next day it rained and the busses all stopped
running. They aren’t running yet. Now we can’t
blame Les for the rain, but what about the busses?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll answer that question when I come back from
Baretti’s. I’m sure that is what Signor Baretti
wishes to talk about.” Marjorie had that morning
received a note from the Italian asking her and
Robin to come to the restaurant at three o’clock that
afternoon. “Bye, Jeremiah. See you later. Truly
I’ll be back to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She encountered Robin when within a few steps
of the inn looking her prettiest in a mink-trimmed
suit of brown and the smartest of mink hats.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such magnificence!” Marjorie exclaimed.
“Why didn’t you tell me there was to be a display
of fashion on the campus this P. M.?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t know it myself until I went over to the
Hall after I left the Biology laboratory this afternoon.
There I found a big box on purpose for
Robin. I ordered this suit in New York just before
I came back to Hamilton. I had to write two
hurry-up letters to the tailor about it, but—here it
is at last.” Robin took a jaunty step or two ahead
of Marjorie better to display her new costume.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“It’s a work of art,” Marjorie smilingly told her
with her ready graciousness. “Guiseppe won’t
realize that I’m present when you burst upon him
in all your glory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well—not quite so bad as that,” Robin disagreed,
chuckling. “He’ll probably say, first thing,
that if you had been here the busses wouldn’t have
stopped running.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’ll do. I think we’re even now.” Marjorie’s
eyes were dancing. She was a lovely picture of
blooming girlhood, the dark green of her long coat
with its wide collar and bands of black fox bringing
out more fully the apple blossom tint of her rounded
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, Miss Dean, you come back again. I am
glad.” Baretti had hastened from the far end of the
room to greet his callers. “You have the nice time
at home? Your father and mother, they are well?”
he asked with polite interest. “I think I never
know before two such nices ones as your father,
your mother.” The Italian had been introduced to
Mr. and Mrs. Dean during the previous June when
they had come to Hamilton to attend the Commencement
exercises.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are very well, thank you, Signor Baretti.
I have brought back their best wishes to you. They
especially asked me to tell you that they appreciated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>your message to them.” The innkeeper had sent
them a message of good will in his sincere, if broken
English.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is good; verra good for me. When you
write the letter, perhaps you have the time say my
good wishes once more to them,” he asked, slightly
hesitant. “Now come, both of you. I have the
fine maple mousse today. My Italiano boys in the
kitchen make. None can make better than these.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We adore the maple mousse your boys make!”
Robin assured Baretti. Marjorie echoed her warm
praise of the dainty.</p>

<p class='c005'>They obediently followed him to one of the vacant
tables and seated themselves in the chairs he pulled
out for them. He stood for a moment ceremoniously
waiting for one or the other of them to ask
him to join them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope you aren’t too busy to sit down at the
table for a few minutes and tell us about the busses,”
Marjorie cordially paved the way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What you think, Miss Page; Miss Dean?” the
little proprietor leaned earnestly forward. An
apple-cheeked Italian waitress had been sent for
the maple mousse. “Sabani send me the word he
don’t run the busses—not if I say so hundred times.
Ha, ha, ha!” Baretti threw back his head with a
derisive laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“How encouraging!” Marjorie exclaimed with
light mockery. In spite of the difficulties that had
overtaken Page and Dean she could not resist smiling
over the child-like message of defiance Sabani
had sent to Baretti.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Italian understood her tone and said. “Now
you only make the fun of me, Miss Dean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What does Sabani intend to do about sending
busses over the campus route?” Robin asked anxiously.
“Why has he cut the campus out? All the
answer we’ve ever received from him to those two
questions is that two of his busses are laid up for
repairs and the third is running entirely on the
Bretan Hill route.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A-a-ah; he only makes the talk. He don’t tell
nothin’ true. Nev-ver-r Sabani tell the truth. He
say me the same he say you, Miss Page. I say him:
‘Look you; this my eye.’ Put my finger to my eye
like this. ‘I see two your busses run in town yesterday.’
Then he is verra mad, but he tell me verra
smart: ‘Oh, yes; you see. That one bus make only
one trip to West Hamilton, then break down again.’
I tell him I am not foolish. I know what I see. I
say: ‘What is the matter you don’t want to give the
dorm girls the service?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was straight from the shoulder.” Marjorie
nodded her approbation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Good for you, Signor Baretti.” Robin lightly
clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He give me the verra queer look. Mebbe he is
the little scared. I speak to him verra quick—look
me so mad.” Baretti straightened in his chair and
gave an illustration of his idea of stern, offended
dignity. “Then he say he don’t know what I mean.
I tell him he will know soon, an’ he won’t like.
Then he is more scare. He say he tell me somethin’
verra private. This is it. He don’t like take the
dorm girls to the campus in the bus for he is mad
because they ride too much in Mariani’s taxies.
Mariani is the <i>nemico</i> to him. That mean hate
verra hard. I laugh at him. I say him that is the
mos’ bigges’ lie he tell yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What an excuse!” Robin turned disgustedly to
Marjorie. “It’s so flimsy it hardly holds together
in the telling. The dormitory girls hardly ever
patronize the taxies on account of the expense,
Signor Baretti,” she explained to their host. “Sabani
appeared well pleased in the beginning to have
those seventy-two fares twice a day, not to mention
the extra campus traffic he received. I never trusted
that man.” Robin shook a disapproving head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw.” Baretti forgot manners and indulged
in his pet “Naw” by way of expressing his contempt.
“Well, I say him, ‘Nev-ver-r you min’,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Sabani, I know the way to do.’ I laugh and go
way from him. I think of Floroni who drive one
the busses. I know he don’t like Sabani. I go in
the street watch for him. He is drive the bus to
Breton Hill. I have to wait long time for him. I
drive my car out on the pike, wait for him there.
I say to him come to my restaurant tonight after
he make last trip. That is ten of the clock. He
say he will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And did he keep his word?” Marjorie asked
eagerly. Two pairs of bright eyes fixed themselves
upon the Italian. Neither girl had missed the note
of triumph which had sprung into his voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, oo-h, yes,” was the instant reply. “Floroni
is my frien’. Now he is my driver for my
truck. I give him this place. He tell me he don’
want work mor’ for Sabani, for he is no good. He
say he can’t give up the place when he has the
family to work for. Then I say him: ‘You don’t
like Sabani. You say me: Why he treat the dorm
girls so bad; don’t give them any service with the
busses?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Baretti made an eloquent pause as his black eyes
sent a triumphant gleam toward one then the other
of his listeners. They watched him in expectation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Floroni say: ‘Yes, I tell you, Sabani don’t tell
me nothin’. I see an’ hear myself. Sabani get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>plenta mona becaus’ he don’t run the busses to the
campus.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Plenty of money because he doesn’t run the
busses?” cried Robin her eyes widening with surprise.
“I can’t see how that——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes-s;” the little proprietor interposed, a
trace of excitement ruffling his quick, stolid assent.
“He get that mona becaus’ Miss Car-rins give to
him. She go to his garage two days before
Thanksgiving; talk to him there. It is in the
morning verra early. Floroni and the other drivers
take out the busses. Floroni happen walk by her.
He hear her tell Sabani this: ‘What you care, an’
I make worth the time.’ He don’t know then what
she mean. Day befor’ Thanksgiving Sabani say
him, ‘I give you holiday tomorrow; mebbe more
days. Two the busses need the repairs. I pay you
jus’ same as when you drive but you stay in the
garage. You wash the cars; do such things.’ And
so it is. He don’t like, but he need the mona’.”
The Italian spread his hands with a deprecating
gesture. “He say, Miss Car-rins make all the
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Listening to Baretti’s information concerning the
bus trouble it occurred to both Robin and Marjorie
in the same instant that they might have expected
to hear the name of Leslie Cairns as the real power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of malice. Robin’s flash of surprise at Baretti’s
first accusation against Sabani instantly died out.
She knew that it was not the first time that Leslie
Cairns had bribed her way to her objectives.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then there is no certainty as to when the busses
will begin running again,” Marjorie said, brows
contracted in a reflective little frown. “What ought
we to do, Signor Baretti?” She glanced appealingly
at the little man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, that is the way I like! I am the one to help
you. It is already done. Tomorrow you see the
busses run to the campus again with the dorm girls.”
Baretti made this promise almost gleefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tomorrow!” two voices rose simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes-s.” Baretti surveyed the amazed firm of
Page and Dean with his broadest, most beaming
smile. “This morning I have go to Sabani. Aa-h-h,
but we have the fight; but not with the hand.” He
doubled a fist and shook his hand. “It was the fight
talk. I scare him; make him think I know all he
say to Miss Car-rins; all she say him. Then I tell
him I will go to the mayor of Hamilton an’ tell
the mayor what he have done. The mayor will
take away his license for the bus line. ‘I make you
many troubles, for you deserve, you don’t run the
busses to the campus tomorrow.’ After while he
say he will do it. He say Miss Car-rins tell him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>it was the joke she want play on the dorm girls. I
say him it is the poor joke, but not so bad as the
joke I will play on him if he don’ run the busses
to the campus tomorrow.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN EVIL INSPIRATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Due to the heavy rain storm on Thanksgiving
Day, Leslie Cairns’ plans had gone considerably
“aglee.” To parade the Dazzler, the white car she
had loaned Doris, with Doris in it and clothed in
expensive white furry finery, had been an impossibility.
In consequence a very much disgruntled
Leslie Cairns had telephoned Doris that “it was all
off” and to meet her instead at the Colonial at
two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the two girls had reached their Thanksgiving
dessert they had come perilously near quarreling.
Leslie was in bad humor because of the inclement
weather. She had the fierce hatred of
being disappointed common to utterly selfish persons.
The news that Doris would grace the hop
on the Saturday evening following Thanksgiving
Day and take charge at the door of the admission
fee to the frolic had not pleased Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You should have known better than to take that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>job, even though it does give you a chance to show
off your looks,” she had upbraided Doris in a surly
tone. “You say you can’t endure Bean and her
crowd. Then—bing!—you whirl about and let
them make a silly of you. Page is Bean’s partner
and one of the celebrated Beanstalks. That didn’t
hinder you from being as sweet as cream to Page
and saying, ‘yes,’ in a hurry when she asked you
to be a little pet donkey and collect the fees at the
hop.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leslie!” Doris had said in a low, furious voice,
“you shall not talk to me in that tone, or call me
a donkey. I won’t stand it. You are simply in a rage
with everything and everybody today because things
didn’t go to suit you. Besides, it was Miss Wenderblatt
not Miss Page who asked me. You are rude
and boorish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll say what I please. I’ve a perfect right to
express an opinion.” Leslie had flung back with
equal fury. “What you’ll have to do is to go and
tell that smug Dutch prig, Wenderblatt, that you
won’t be able to do the tax-collection stunt Saturday
night. You have another engagement. You
<i>have</i>, you know. One with <i>me</i>. We’ll go to the
Lotus to dinner and wander into that select rube
recreation palace known as the Hamilton Opera
House.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“I do not intend to tell Miss Wenderblatt any
such thing,” Doris had retorted with belligerent independence.
“Just remember she is Professor
Wenderblatt’s daughter. This stunt I am to do at
the hop will boom me a lot on the campus. I have
a perfectly ducky dress to wear. Besides Miss
Peyton and Miss Barton are going to try to start a
beauty contest at the hop. There is no doubt but
that I shall win it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your chances <i>are</i> fair since Bean’s taken her
precious self to dear Sanford, the place where Beans
and Beanstocks grow,” Leslie had sneered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are so impossible today, Leslie. I sha’n’t
lower myself by quarreling with you,” had been
Doris’s ultimatum, delivered in offended haughtiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’d never win a prize for amiability. You’re
the most selfish proposition, Doris Monroe, that
I’ve ever met,” Leslie had retaliated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get acquainted with yourself,” Doris had sarcastically
advised.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ending of their Thanksgiving dinner had
been punctuated freely with other similar pleasantries.
The two self-willed girls had left the Colonial
hardly on speaking terms. It was nearing half
past three o’clock when they had stepped outside
the tea room. The rain having stopped Doris had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>sulkily announced her intention to walk to Wayland
Hall instead of allowing Leslie to run her
there in the car. Leslie had snapped back: “Don’t
care what you do. You’re too selfish to consider
me. You know I counted on you to help me amuse
myself tonight in that dead dump of a town. Go
to the dance. I hope you have a punk evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In going to the hop I’m only doing what you
asked me to do quite a while ago. You told me
then that you wanted me to make myself popular
on the campus. Well; this is the way to do it.
Think it over. You’ll find I’m right,” had been
Doris’s parting shot as she separated from her ill-humored
companion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Determining to teach Doris a lesson, Leslie let
the rest of the week go by without holding any
communication with the sophomore. She had spent
a lonely Thanksgiving evening and blamed Doris
heavily because of it. She was also dreadfully
miffed at the partial failure of her contemptible
plot against the dormitory girls’ welfare. When
she had awakened on Thanksgiving morning, to see
violently weeping skies that promised an all-day
deluge, she had smiled contentedly. She had effectually
blocked Bean’s plans for the day. And
for a good many days to come! Such was her belief,
when, after having posted herself in the palm-screened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>window of the florist’s shop to see that
Sabani kept his word and ran no busses, she had
frowningly witnessed the arrival of Phil, Barbara
and Robin on the scene and what followed as a
result of their timely arrival.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Leslie had had the galling experience of
seeing the Thanksgiving part of her plot far on
the way to failure she had flung out of the florist’s
in a rage, jumped into her car and set off for the
campus without any definite reason whatever for
going there. The main point had been to keep
“rag, tag and bob-tail,” as she had ironically named
the off-campus girls, from getting to the “free
feed” at the “dago’s hash house.” She had failed
to do this. The “beggars” had managed to reach
Baretti’s in spite of the rain. They would return
to town in the same way that they had come.
Leslie felt particularly spiteful toward Robin Page.
So very spiteful that she indulged her rancor in
“splashing” Phil and Robin when the opportunity
chanced to offer itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the Sunday afternoon following Thanksgiving
while the Travelers, old and new, had gathered in
Marjorie’s room in serious confab over the momentous
happenings of the Thanksgiving holiday, Leslie
Cairns had sat lazily stretched in an easy chair
in her hotel room, eyes half closed, her dark mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>wholly concentrated on an idea which had just introduced
itself to her. It was an evil inspiration,
born of a group of headlines she had glanced at in
one of the Sunday papers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder why I never thought of that before,”
she had said half aloud as she dipped a hand into
a box of nut chocolates on the table beside her and
thoughtfully nibbled a cream nut. “I wish I dared
ask <i>him</i> to help me. He could do what I want done
as quickly as a wink. He couldn’t kick, either, for
he has handled more than one such stunt. I think
I’ll write him. ‘Nothing venture nothing have.’ I’ll
wait a few days until I see how the bus scheme
works out, then I’ll write. I’ve never written him
since he—since he—.” Leslie’s voice had faltered.
She had sat staring into the ruddy embers of the
open fire looking less like a malicious mischief-maker
and more like a sorrowful young woman
than ever before. There was only one person in
the world who had ever commanded Leslie’s respect
and tenderness. That one was her father.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A BUSY INVESTIGATOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>On Monday, Leslie, now elated by her newest
plan, relented and called Doris Monroe on the telephone.
While she had been ready to condemn Doris
for going to the hop, nevertheless she had a
thriving curiosity to know what had happened at
the dance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two girls met by appointment at the Colonial
and in a far pleasanter frame of mind than that
of the preceding Thursday.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I may go to New York,” Leslie announced, directly
they had found a table to suit their difficult
fancy and seated themselves. “I’m expecting a letter
or a telegram from”—Leslie checked herself
abruptly—“from a dear friend,” she continued.
“Even if I shouldn’t hear from this friend I may
go anyway.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, of course, I can’t get leave of absence
to go with you.” Doris spoke pettishly, dissatisfaction
looming large on her perfect features. “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>made a mistake in not going there at Thanksgiving.
You could have gone. It rained too hard for
you to attend to any business about your garage
site.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all you know about it,” Leslie indulged
in one of her silent laughs. “I was very busy in
town on Thanksgiving morning. Don’t get New
Yorkitis, Goldie. We’ll go to little old N. Y. for
the Easter vacation. Maybe our house will be open
then,” she predicted hopefully. She felt signally
cheered even by the remote prospect.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie had already begun the composition of a
letter to her father. She wrote, crossed out and re-wrote.
She had not yet evolved from her labor the
letter she hoped would soften her father’s unforgiving
heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When will you go to New York?” Doris showed
signs of mollification. The promise of an Easter
vacation in New York with Leslie to show her the
metropolis was something to be gracious over.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t know. Not for a week. Perhaps not for
two.” Leslie donned her most indifferent air. She
had volunteered as much as she thought wise to
Doris concerning her New York trip. “Tell me
about the hop,” she said craftily, switching the
subject from herself to her companion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, it was so, so.” Doris shrugged lightly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“My pale blue frock was sweet. A lot of fuss was
made over me. There wasn’t a Beauty contest.”
Her face registered disappointment. “Julia Peyton
said she’d start one, but she couldn’t make it
go. The crowd was crazy to dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is a big bluff, and her pal, red-headed Miss
Carter is a stupid. Look out for both of them,”
was Leslie’s succinct criticism. She had been introduced
to the two sophs by Doris and had mentally
decided against both.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They have been awfully sweet to me,” Doris returned
half offended. She did not enjoy having her
admirers belittled. “So were Miss Page, Miss
Moore and the rest of that new sorority. Miss Page
is charming. What a pity she throws herself away
on that horrid Sanford crowd. I was glad they
weren’t at the hop. I’d not have taken charge of
the admission fee if they had been.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You would if it had happened to suit you,” Leslie
coolly told her. Then she laughed. “Don’t
bristle and get ready to throw quills at me, Goldie.
I know you thoroughly. I must say I’m surprised
to hear you raving over Page when you know Page
and Bean are my special abomination.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You never said a word about Miss Page,” Doris
flashed back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s a Beanstalk. Wasn’t that enough to let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>you know what I thought of her? Aren’t she and
Bean always together?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not crazy about Miss Page,” Doris jerked
out angrily. She purposely avoided answering Leslie’s
questions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll say you’re not. There’s only one person
you are crazy about. That’s Doris Monroe,” Leslie
said with savage emphasis.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s not fair, nor true,” sputtered Doris. Unguardedly
her clear cold tones rose higher than she
knew. “I’m not crazy about myself—or anyone
else. I’d like you best of all, Leslie, if you weren’t
so awfully bullying. I won’t be bullied. That’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it would appear.” Leslie’s retort was grimly
sarcastic. “Sorry you had to tell the natives
about it.” She made an angry movement of the
head toward the next table below them. Around it
sat Gussie Forbes, Calista Wilmot and Flossie
Hart, placidly eating ices.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They couldn’t hear what I said,” Doris defended,
half abashed, half sulky. “I’m sure they
couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re the one to worry, if they did,” shrugged
Leslie. “It can’t do one little bit of harm to me.
Forget it. What do you know about this bus trouble
the bread and cheese priggies are having? Have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the busses really stopped running between town and
the campus? I heard they stopped on Thanksgiving
Day. I haven’t seen you since then.” Leslie made
a success of looking innocent.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had not divulged to Doris, either before or
on Thanksgiving Day, her part in the bus trouble.
Bitter experience with the Sans had taught her the
value of keeping her own counsel. She now listened
to Doris’s vague information concerning the
non-running busses, an enigmatical smile playing
upon her lips. She was delighted to hear of the inconvenience
her scheme had caused and determined
that it should continue indefinitely. She had money.
Sabani would do as she ordered so long as plenty
of money accompanied her orders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those two were certainly having a fuss,” commented
Flossie Hart as the three sophomores left
the tea room, directly after Doris’s angry outburst.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to tell Marjorie about it.” Gussie
made the announcement with great decision.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Telling tales is a bad practice,” laughingly rebuked
Flossie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know why you’re going to.” Calista’s quick
mind instantly jumped at a certain conclusion. “I
will, if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m still in the dark,” mourned Flossie. “Kindly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>enlighten me. Forgive me for being so stupid.
Doesn’t that sound just like Muriel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Floss. Muriel might think it was herself
talking if she happened to hear you.” Gussie favored
her room-mate with a condescending smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three hurried along the street to the main
campus gate. “Race you to the Hall,” challenged
Gussie the instant they set foot on the snow-patched
brown of the campus. A playful wind, not too penetrating,
frolicked with them as they ran, blowing
added bloom into their cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aside from the one remark Flossie had made
about Doris and Leslie Cairns nothing else had been
said. As members of the new Travelers the Bertram
girls were endeavoring to live up to one of
the basic rules of their code; never to discuss anyone
for the interest derived from the discussion. The
discussion must come as necessary to the promotion
of welfare.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope Marjorie’s in.” Gussie was presently
pounding vigorously on the door of 15, a chum at
each elbow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not leave us the door?” blandly inquired
Jerry as she opened it to the vociferous demand for
admission. “Is it really you, Gentleman Gus? I
haven’t seen you for as much as three hours. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>last occasion was at lunch.” Jerry smirked soulfully
at her callers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s Marjorie?” Gussie peered over Jerry’s
head and into the room. “We’ve a bit of special
information. You’re privileged to hear it too, Jeremiah?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has gone to Baretti’s. She was to meet
Robin and go there. They had an appointment with
Guiseppe. He wrote Marjorie one of his one-line
funny little notes. I think he has news for Page
and Dean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Um-m.” Gussie looked undecided for a moment.
“We’ll come back later.” She looked first
at her chums for conformation, then at Jerry. “Let
us know when she comes, Jerry. We love you
dearly enough to hang around in your room till
Marjorie comes, but there’s a time for study, et
cetera. Only I don’t know when it will be if not
now. You may pound on my door as hard as I
pounded on yours, but no harder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suit yourself,” Jerry waved an affable hand.
“I can live without you. I have a letter to write.
I’d enjoy perfect quiet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three sophomores went gaily down the hall.
Jerry again shut herself in her room to write
a letter which she had for some time been searching
for an excuse to write. That very morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>in the corridor of Hamilton Hall she had found it.
It had come in the shape of a particularly sheer,
dainty, hand-embroidered handkerchief, bearing the
monogram L. M. W. Instantly her mind had began
to canvass among the initials of her friends for
L. M. W. Intending to place it in the students’
“Lost and Found,” after class Jerry had tucked it
away in her hand bag and hurried to her recitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>During class her mind continued to revert to the
initials L. M. W. Jerry thoroughly enjoyed being
baffled temporarily by a problem which she was
confident she would solve eventually. In the midst
of her cogitations she chanced to call to mind the
name of a student whose initials were surely L. M.
W. Whereupon a beatific smile paused on Jerry’s
face for a second. She promptly forgot her surroundings
to dwell triumphantly instead upon the
beauty of a certain stunt she determined to “put
over” as soon as she returned to her room. Nor
did she visit the “Lost and Found” on her way to
the Hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seated at the study table Jerry eyed the dainty
handkerchief meditatively. Should she write to
L. M. W., whom she hoped was Louise M. Walker,
merely asking the sophomore if she had lost the
beautiful bit of linen, or should she fold the handkerchief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>inside a note she would write, asking Miss
Walker to place the article in the “Lost and Found”
should it not belong to her? Jerry considered the
problem owlishly, then wrote:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Walker</span>:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you lost a handkerchief? I am enclosing
one I found, in the corridor of Hamilton Hall, bearing
your initials. If it is not yours, will you kindly
place it in the ‘Lost and Found’?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“<span class='sc'>Geraldine Macy</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“There! She’ll be an untutored savage if she ignores
my kindly little act,” Jerry decided with a
grin. “If I wrote asking her if she’d lost the handkerchief
she might ’phone me, or come here. That’s
not what I’m after. She ought to write me a line
of acknowledgment. If she should—I’ll know one
thing that I don’t know now.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MARJORIE FINDS A SUPPORTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Marjorie returned from Baretti’s full of the glorious
news of the little proprietor’s triumph over
Sabani in behalf of Page and Dean. Jerry was
equally elated and burst into one of what she had
named “Joyful Jingles to Bean.” She spouted
them on special occasions.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thanks to our faithful dago friend</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The Goblin’s schemes fell through.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis plainly seen, oh, upright Bean</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such trouble’s not for you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>She did a fantastic polka step around Marjorie,
keeping time with her declamation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You funny old goose!” Marjorie caught her
and wrapped both arms about her. “Yes, the Goblin’s
scheme did fall through, and, oh, rapture, the
busses will begin running again tomorrow morning!
What would we have done without Signor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Baretti’s help? He’s splendid in his interest in
our work here. He ranks with Miss Susanna,
Prexy and Professor Wenderblatt as our most
loyal supporters. Now I must tell you what he
did.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, save it till I go for Gus, Calista and Flossie.
Let them hear it. They’ve been looking for
you. They’ve something on their minds. So has
Jeremiah. This is another wildly eventful day.”
Jerry smiled warmly down on Marjorie who had
taken off her wraps and was now lounging in one
of the arm chairs. She reclined there, a graceful
lissome figure in her straight gown of pale jade
broadcloth, with no trimming save that of her
superb young beauty to set it off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the days here are somehow wildly eventful,”
Marjorie said with a little devoted smile.
“Something remarkable seems always to be happening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too true,” Jerry agreed with solemnity. “But
some days are even more eventful than that. I will
mention as an example the day before we went
home for Thanksgiving.” Both girls began to
laugh. “That was some day. Muriel began it
right by tipping her cup of coffee into my lap.
Next. I fell down three steps of the stairs. Next.
I dropped a new library book in the mud. Next.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>I went to the gym to see Gentleman Gus and got
hit on the nose with the ball. Next. I couldn’t
find my suitcase in the trunk room so I had to
borrow one. Do you recall any other exciting misfortunes
of that particular day?” She turned innocently
inquiring eyes upon Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nope. You were a martyr that day, poor old
Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I need your sympathy, Bean,” Jerry rejoined
brokenly. “It’s a hard world for some folks. Still
I’m glad I’ve survived.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cheer up. Here come the Bertramites.” Marjorie’s
keen ears had caught the sound of familiar
voices. She went to the door and ushered in the
trio of sophs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the latest from Guiseppe, the defender?”
Gussie immediately clamored to know. The three
girls surrounded Marjorie while Jerry made an
equally eager fourth member of the group.</p>

<p class='c005'>It did not take long to put them in possession
of the good news. They received it with enthusiasm,
modified to keep within the limit of noise.
Since the evening when Marjorie and Jerry had
been called to the door by Miss Peyton on the
head of being disturbers of quiet no more reports
had been made against them. Miss Peyton’s threat
that she would place the matter before President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Matthews had evidently never been carried out.
Marjorie could only hope that it had not. The
president’s cordiality to her whenever they chanced
to meet assured her of his regard. Still she disliked
the idea intensely of being reported to headquarters
for anything so utterly uncontrolled and
childish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a strange, dreadful life for a girl to
lead!” exclaimed Calista Wilmot. She referred to
Marjorie’s account of Leslie Cairns’ part in the
bus trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it is.” Marjorie’s reply was spoken in all
seriousness. “After Signor Baretti had told us
of what she had done Robin and I both thought we
ought not tell even you girls of it. Then we
thought of the way Phil, Barbara and the rest of
you helped break up her plot by coming out with
your cars in the storm. We decided it was only
fair to tell you the exact circumstances. The
Travelers, old and new, should be, and are, I’m
sure, trustworthy. None of them would circulate
any of the private business of the club about the
campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s another argument just as strong as to
why Leslie Cairns’ actions shouldn’t be kept secret
from the club. She doesn’t deserve to be shielded
for what she did.” Gussie’s handsome, colorful face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>showed shocked disapproval. “Why, she has acted
just like a regular old politician who goes around
before election day and buys votes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gussie’s comparison raised a laugh in which Marjorie
joined. Long ago she and Robin had come
to that conclusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, we won’t ever say a word about her outside
the Travelers,” she said, her face sobering.
“Everything’s going nicely again. Now, children,
my tale’s told. Jerry says you have something on
your minds. Go sit on that couch, three in a row,
and spout forth your news.” Marjorie indicated
her couch bed. “If you don’t care to sit there,
why, here is our assortment of chairs.” She
grandly pointed them out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let Gus tell it. She began it,” declared Flossie.
The three friends had bumped themselves
down on the couch, with much interference one with
another and little bursts of laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your fairy-tale Princess and Leslie Cairns had
a fuss at the Colonial today. They were together
there when the three of us went into the place for
ices.” Gussie said in matter-of-fact tones. “Miss
Monroe was ripping mad. We heard her say that
something wasn’t true, and that she wouldn’t be
bullied. She was so angry she talked louder than
she intended. I think she knew it for all in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>minute she dropped her voice away down. I wanted
to be the one to tell you about this, Marjorie, for
a certain reason.” Her tone was flattering to Marjorie’s
dignity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Speak, Gentleman Gus,” laughed Marjorie,
amused by the very solemn expression of Gussie’s
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just because Miss Monroe was opposed to me
at class election is no sign that I should have any
hard feeling toward her,” Gussie began. “I haven’t.
I know you think she’s going to—to—well, be more
congenial some day. She won’t be, though, if she
keeps on associating with Miss Cairns. She’ll begin
to break rules, too. First thing she knows
she’ll do something serious and be expelled from
Hamilton. I can’t forget how sweet she looked
the other night at the hop. I thought, since she
seemed to be peeved with Miss Cairns that maybe
you could think of some way to link her to Hamilton.
So she’ll like the campus better than she does
Leslie Cairns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have thought of a way, Gussie,” Marjorie’s
eyes sparkled. At last she had a supporter in the
cause of the difficult fairy-tale princess.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We ought to forget there is any such person,”
Calista said. “After the way she reported us for
being noisy on the day we got here. But you see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>what forgiving natures we have.” She gave a
whimsical little shrug and smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I decided to forget that she reported us,” came
from Gussie magnanimously. “She’s awfully
thorny and hard to approach. She doesn’t seem
to care much for Miss Peyton and Miss Carter.
They make great effort toward being chummy
with her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leila knows I’d like to have a Beauty contest;
the kind of one she got up when we were freshmen
and she and Vera were sophs,” Marjorie
told them animatedly. “If we had one—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good old M. M. thinks the Ice Queen would
win it. That would let M. M. out of being the
college beauty—so she innocently schemes,” translated
Jerry. “We’d still be privileged to our own
opinion, Ahem.” She coughed suggestively. Next
instant she had gone to the door in answer to a
rapping on it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re just in time,” she greeted, stepping back
to allow Leila to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In time for what, may I ask?” Leila’s bright
blue eyes roved speculatively about the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For the Beauty contest,” returned Calista
promptly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I must have won it. I see no one half as
beautiful as myself here,” was Leila’s modest opinion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“But have you seen Vera? Midget is gone,
unless you may be hiding her away in some small
corner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She went to town with Phil. Robin and I met
them when we came from Baretti’s.” Marjorie
continued with a brief account of Robin’s and her
call at the inn.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Once more she has dropped her gold into the
sea,” was Leila’s thoroughly Irish comment. “It
is the same old story, Beauty. She never wins.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bean hopes to be Bean without beauty,” Jerry
said briskly to Leila. “Can it be done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall have to consult the stars.” Leila rolled
her eyes mysteriously at Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind me, Leila, won’t you please help
me about the Beauty contest. You know why I
am so determined to have it. Gussie feels the same
as I do about Miss Monroe. So does Calista. I’ve
two on my side.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Count me in, Bean. Never forget your friend.”
Jerry sprang to Marjorie’s support.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And me,” echoed Flossie Hart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sorry, Beauty, but I can’t help you with
the contest.” Leila pursed her lips and shook her
black head. “Now, why should you bother your
head about it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I think it is the one thing to do for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Miss Monroe. I want to do it, Leila. Why won’t
you help me?” Marjorie sent Leila a puzzled, almost
hurt glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why won’t I help you? Because—” Leila’s smile
burst forth from her sober face like sunlight
through a cloud—“I shall be busy managing the
Beauty contest myself.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>NEWS FROM MISS SUSANNA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going out to mail a letter,” Jerry told Marjorie,
when, later, the girls had gone to their own
rooms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How nice. You may have the pleasure of mailing
two for me,” Marjorie reached in the table
drawer for the letters. “I put them in the drawer
for safe keeping and went out without them, she
explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hand them over.” Jerry took them and was
gone. She had decided to say nothing to anyone
about the letter she had written to Louise Walker
until she had seen the outcome. Like the sleuth
she had laughingly vowed to be, at the time when
Marjorie had received the letter from Louise
Walker and also the one signed “Senior sports’
committee,” she preferred to keep matters a secret
until she had completed her case.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the way back across the campus from the
nearest mail box she saw a mail carrier leaving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Hall. In going out she had noted that the bulletin
board in the hall was empty of mail. Now a flock
of letters roosted in its alphabetical, shallow pockets.
Near the top under D she plucked one for Marjorie
addressed in Miss Susanna Hamilton’s individual
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re in luck,” Jerry said as she entered the
room to find Marjorie sitting at the table, elbows
braced upon it, hands cupping her chin. A rare
old book on chemistry lay near her on the table.
It had been given her by Miss Hamilton during
her senior year at Hamilton. She had brought it
from her bookshelf to read. Instead she had fallen
into a reverie concerning the giver of the book.
Miss Susanna had told her that it was the only
copy of the work on chemistry known to be in the
United States. It had belonged to Mr. Brooke
Hamilton. Marjorie could hardly believe at times
that she was actually in possession of a book that
had belonged to the founder of Hamilton College.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why am I in luck?” Marjorie’s head was quickly
raised from her hands. “I never seem to be
much out of it, Jeremiah. I have so much more
of happiness than I deserve.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s a reason.” The envelope in Jerry’s
hand dropped on the table in front of Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh-h-h!” Marjorie exultantly snatched up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>letter. “I was just thinking of her, Jerry. I’ve
had only one letter from her since she has been
in New York. Doesn’t it seem odd to think of
Miss Susanna as being in New York? She’s been
away from the Arms almost six weeks, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie’s hands were already busy with the
envelope. She drew from it the folded letter,
spread it open and glanced eagerly at the headlines.
Then she read aloud to Jerry who had seated herself
on one end of the table, feet swinging free.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>My Dearest Child</span>:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am still in this roaring, clattering, over-populated
city they call New York. I shall be glad to
see the last of it. It has changed a good deal since
I visited it twenty years ago. This is the day of
motor vehicles, skyscrapers and crowded streets
filled with strange foreign faces. I long to be home
to that haven of peace, the Arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no use in attempting to tell you by
letter of my stay in the metropolis. I am coming
home on Tuesday, December fourth. Will you
and Jerry come to the Arms to dinner on Wednesday
evening? I should have written you more
often, but I have been very busy by day and tired
by night. At any rate I have seen the New York
of today. But I could never grow used to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>helter-skelter, rush-and-a-bounce way of living that
appears to prevail here.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give my love to my girls with my fond devotion
for yourself.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c007'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Susanna Craig Hamilton.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“She’ll be home tomorrow. Oh, goody!” Marjorie
sprang from her chair and essayed a little
prancing step about the room, looking like a delighted
youngster. Miss Susanna’s pet name of
“child” was particularly applicable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Wednesday we’ll see her!” Jerry contributed
a few hops and skips to the dance Marjorie
had started. The two met, clasped each other and
the dance became wilder. Breathless and laughing,
they landed with a bang against the door. They
managed for a moment to keep out Ronny who was
at the door, hand on the knob, when the dancers
crashed against it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got in, even if you did try to hold the door
against me,” she asserted with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My, but you are suspicious!” Jerry accused.
“That’s not the way we treat our friends. Didn’t
you know it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I really your friend?” Ronny asked with
gushing sweetness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were, you are, but you won’t be long if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>you ask me any more such foolish questions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Susanna will be home tomorrow, Ronny,”
Marjorie said happily. “She sent her love to you
girls. Here’s her letter. I’m sure she’d like you
to read it.” Marjorie was still holding the letter.
She now handed it to Ronny.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ronny took it and quickly read it. “Why did
she go to New York, I wonder, after having stayed
so long away from it?” she questioned half musingly.
“It would take an especially strong reason
to draw her away from the Arms for six weeks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whatever the reason may have been, we’ll probably
know it tomorrow evening,” Jerry commented.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if she’d been planning
something for the dormitory and had had to go to
New York to find just what she wanted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We don’t wish her to do anything more for the
dormitory,” Marjorie said sturdily. “She has done
too much for us already.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Precisely my opinion. You won’t let me throw
my money around in the dormitory cause. Why
should Miss Susanna be allowed to do what I’m
not?” Ronny propounded with one of her dazzling,
patronizing smiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I call for a change of subject,” laughed Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“And my question not answered,” Ronny sighed
plaintively.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The answer to your question is the road to argument.”
Marjorie cannily shook a finger at Veronica.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right. You’ve suppressed me for the time
being. Never fear. I’ll bob up again on the finance
question when you least expect it,” she made
cheerful prediction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a sweet, precious pet, and it sha’n’t be suppressed.”
Marjorie reached out and stroked Ronny’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s what you call Ruffle when you are trying
to coax him to jump through your arms. You
can’t hope that I’ll be much impressed by such blarney,”
Ronny pointed out with hastily assumed dignity.
“I’m going to leave you now. I came here
for a purpose, but I’ve forgotten what it was. I’ll
have to go back to our room and consult Luciferous.
Luckily, I confided in her before starting out.”
Ronny flitted from the room in her graceful, light-footed
fashion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I could see fluffy old Ruffle and squabble
with him and General for our favorite chair.” Marjorie’s
eyes grew suddenly wistful. “And, Captain!
I miss her most of all. More so this year
than I did before I was graduated.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“I miss Father and Mother sometimes, but Hal
is the one I miss.” Jerry’s color heightened a little
as she mentioned her brother’s name to Marjorie.
“You know Hal and I were pally at home. Outside
the house he was always with the boys, but inside
we spent many hours together. He taught me to
box, fence, swim and ride. And during the past
two summers at the beach you’ve seen for yourself
how much we have been together.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During the short Thanksgiving vacation in Sanford
Jerry had been faintly encouraged by Marjorie’s
warmly cordial manner to Hal. The strain
between them which her keen intuition had detected
when at the beach had vanished. As a matter of
fact, Marjorie welcomed the four days of pleasure
and happiness at home as a release from responsibility.
She wished to think of nothing but
home and its charms. She hailed Hal frankly as
her cavalier of old and treated him with all the
gay graciousness of her first acquaintance with
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal was too deeply in love with Marjorie not to
understand her. He knew that she was not behaving
toward him according to some carefully laid
plan of her own. Her overflowing gaiety was
spontaneous. She was like a blithe, lovely child,
full of the joy of living, who looked to him to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>her playmate. So Hal made a Herculean effort
to crowd the love she did not want into his heart
and close the door upon it. He resolutely forbade
himself to think of her as other than his old-time
“girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal is the finest young man I ever met, or ever
expect to meet,” Marjorie said with an energy of
enthusiasm far removed from love. “I hope he
will find a girl who is as splendid as he is, and
marry her. I wish Hal would fall in love with
Ronny, and Ronny with Hal. They would be
worthy of each other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie laughed as she caught the variety of
expressions struggling for place on Jerry’s round
face. “You look so funny, Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you wonder? Ronny never occurred to me
in the light of a sister-in-law.” Jerry’s variegated
expression dissolved in a broad smile. “You take
my breath. I’ll have to mention it to her when
she comes in again. Her views on the subject
might give me another shock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jerry Macy, if you do, I’ll—I’ll—” Marjorie
caught Jerry by her well-cushioned shoulders and
began to shake her with playful force. “Don’t you
dare, Jeremiah.” She emphasized her words with
little shakes. “Promise me you won’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you take me for?” Jerry asked reproachfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“I’d never have the nerve to mention
old Hal to Ronny. No, Marvelous Match Maker,
you’ll never be able to marry Hal off so easily as
that. There are scads and oodles and slathers of
lovely girls in the world, but there’s one grand reason
why none of them will ever give me a glad
hand as a sister-in-law. Hal saw you first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, little girls, I’m so glad to be home again!
I’ve been outdoors tramping around the estate since
early this morning. Do give me another cup of
tea, Jerry.” Miss Susanna had ordered the dinner
dessert served in the tea room with tea as an
after-dinner beverage instead of coffee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yours truly.” Jerry refilled the thin priceless
cup, it belonged to the famous Chinese tea set, and
offered it to Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has seemed so strange without you, Miss Susanna.”
Marjorie bent affectionate eyes on the upright
little figure in black silk. “Not to see you
for six weeks during the college year is a long
time now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it is; so it is,” nodded the old lady. “I had
no intention of leaving the Arms for that shrieking
demon of noise, New York. The last time you had
tea with me, Marjorie, was just before Hallowe’en.
I was thinking then about having a Hallowe’en
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>frolic for you girls. Then Jonas brought me a
letter from an old friend of mine who lives in New
York. In the letter he mentioned something so interesting
that it set me to thinking hard. The upshot
of it was I told Jonas I intended to go to New
York. He nearly collapsed with amazement.” Miss
Susanna chuckled at the recollection of Jonas’s unbelieving
surprise. “When I went on to tell him
why I was going he was as much pleased with my
plan as I was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Hamilton paused. Her alert dark eyes were
dancing with some secret of her own which gave
promise of being signally amusing. Jerry and Marjorie
knew the signs. Miss Susanna was on the
verge of imparting to them something in the nature
of a pleasant surprise. Jerry’s surmise of the
afternoon that the last of the Hamiltons had gone
to New York in the interests of the dormitory
flashed into the minds of both girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The odd feature of the whole affair is, Jonas
has been elected to go to New York, now that I’ve
returned to the Arms.” Miss Susanna’s gleeful,
child-like chuckle was heard. “Poor Jonas. He
looked so horrified when I informed him of what
I had in store for him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shall we inquire what it’s all about?” Jerry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>flashed Marjorie the pretense of a bewildered
glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the only way we’ll ever find out,” sighed
Marjorie in an exaggeratedly hopeless tone. “Unless
we pounce upon Jonas in the hall and bully
him into telling us.” She turned the merest fraction
of a glance on Miss Hamilton as she proposed
this violent means of obtaining information.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A good plan,” heartily approved Jerry. “I’ll
improve upon it. I suggest that we rush him, or
anyone else around here who may happen to know
something we don’t, but would like to know. Let’s
begin now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on.” Marjorie rose and brandished two
bare, smooth, dimpled arms threateningly in Miss
Susanna’s direction. Jerry followed suit, even
more menacing of gesture. Her ridiculous, desperado
thrust of chin, the slow, determined advance
of the pair upon the little, bright-eyed figure in the
chair further added to the astonishment of Jonas
as he suddenly appeared in the tea room to refill
the tea-pot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess I got here just in time,” he slyly declared,
his mouth drawing into a humorous pucker
as he picked up the tea-pot to refill it with fresh
tea.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In time to land yourself in difficulties; not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>save me,” Miss Susanna told him between chuckles.
“We’re both threatened with attack, Jonas, unless
we stand and deliver our great secret.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna had thrown herself into the spirit
of the bit of by-play with the merry zest of a child.
Since she had known Marjorie and the light-hearted,
fun-loving coterie of Hamilton girls she
had appeared to grow younger and younger. That
particular, congenial galaxy of youth Miss Susanna
had taken to her heart as a charm against crabbed
old age.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe we’d better not make any resistance,
Miss Susanna,” Jonas advised with a timid air.
It reduced the two desperadoes to a state of giggles
which utterly broke up their threatening aspect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe we hadn’t,” the old lady agreed with
brisk amusement. “You sit down at the table with
us and have a cup of tea, Jonas. There’s safety in
numbers.” She graciously waved Jonas into the one
vacant chair of the four around the table. Had he
been her elder brother instead of her major-domo
of many years she could not have treated him with
more kindly affection.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s mean in me to tease you children,” she said,
flashing her guests one of her bright smiles. “Forgive
me. I’m really going to tell you all about it
now.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“The past is forgot,” Jerry moaned ungrammatically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you,” Miss Susanna responded gratefully.
“I was hoping it might be. Now for the
tale of my adventures in New York. My lawyer,
who was young when I was, left Hamilton many
years ago and established himself in New York.
His name is Richard Henry Garrett. He never
married. During our younger days we lost track
of each other. Later we met again and after Uncle
Brooke’s death I engaged him to attend to the
legalities of the estate. Uncle Brooke’s lawyer
died shortly after my great uncle’s decease.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since the laying of the dormitory corner stone
last fall,” Miss Susanna continued, “I have often
wondered what I could give the girls who are to
live there that would be of use and benefit to all.
When the dormitory is completed I shall carry out
a certain wish of Uncle Brooke’s of which at present
I prefer not to speak. What I was anxious to do
was something personal for the girls’ welfare. In
the midst of my quandary I received my old friend
Richard’s letter. I had not finished reading it when
the very idea I was seeking came to me. Let me
read you the paragraph of his letter which furnished
my inspiration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna drew from an ornamental ruffled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>silk pocket of her skirt the folded sheets of a letter.
She unfolded them; hunted them for the desired
paragraph. She quickly found it and read in her
brisk tones:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Since you used to be greatly interested in old
and rare books you will remember the Ellerton’s
fine private library which I once took you to see
when you were in New York. It is to be sold soon,
at auction, as a whole. The elder Ellertons have
died and the heirs to the Ellerton estate prefer to
convert the library into cash. It appears to be the
chief aim of the rising generation to convert everything
of beauty and worth, which has a monetary
value, into dollars, regardless of tradition. So that
splendid monument to learning, Steven Ellerton’s
library, will come under the auctioneer’s hammer
next month.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sure the Ellerton library <i>couldn’t</i> be finer
than the Hamilton Arms’ library,” Marjorie said
in loyal defense of the remarkable collection of
volumes gathered together by Brooke Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not as complete, if I remember rightly,”
Miss Susanna said, looking pleased at Marjorie’s
staunch opinion. “Uncle Brooke has some rare
Chinese and Japanese books and a collection of
Spanish incunabula which I know the Ellerton
library lacks, as well as a good many other rare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>and curious books of which he possessed the only
known copies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna’s face broke into a little, amused
smile as she glanced from one to the other of the
two girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You girls must surely understand by this time
what my inspiration was. You both look a trifle
bewildered. Can’t you add two and two, children?”
she asked playfully. “You ought to know
the result.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it’s such an overwhelming result, Miss Susanna!”
Marjorie drew a long breath. “Two,
which stands for the dormitory girls, plus, two,
which stands for the Ellerton library make—”
Marjorie paused. She gazed at Miss Hamilton, her
eyes bright as stars. “It’s too wonderful even to
think about;—until I grow more used to the idea.
It’s too great a gift, Miss Susanna, after all you’ve
already done for the dormitory project.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense. Nothing is too great for me to give,
provided I have it to give, and feel like giving it,”
declared the old lady brusquely. “I like the idea
of the dormitory having its own library. I have
only one request to make concerning it. I’d like
to have the library named the Brooke Hamilton
Dormitory Library.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just as though we <i>could</i> give it another name!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Marjorie exclaimed with fond fervor. “I’d say it
ought to be named for you but I know you would
rather use Mr. Brooke’s name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course I should.” Miss Hamilton gave an
emphatic little nod of the head. “I shouldn’t like
the ‘Susanna Hamilton Dormitory Library,’ as a
name. Should you, child?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; I should,” Marjorie disagreed with affectionate
frankness. Jerry echoed the opinion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a couple of nice children. I appreciate
your loyal approval,” Miss Susanna told them. Her
tones took on an odd grimness as she added: “My
name shall not appear in connection with a Hamilton
College movement, however worthy it may be.
In the case of his name, there’s a difference. He
had the right to hope that his name might be perpetuated
in the college his genius and benevolence
raised up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘The college his genius and benevolence raised
up,’” Marjorie meditatively repeated. “How beautiful
that would be in a biography of Mr. Brooke
Hamilton.” She flushed, but looked bravely at
Miss Susanna. She had, in thus speaking, obeyed
an irresistible impulse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Answering color signals displayed themselves in
the old lady’s cheeks. A frown sprang to her brows.
It disappeared almost instantly. Her alert dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>eyes grew tender. “It was a fortunate day for
Hamilton when a certain curly-haired little girl
first set foot on the campus. Why not call the
new dormitory the Marjorie Dean Dormitory?
The dream dormitory that Marjorie Dean’s unselfish
work made a reality. That’s what Uncle
Brooke would say if he were here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How I love you for saying that, Miss Susanna,
about Mr. Brooke Hamilton!” Marjorie cried happily.
“But I think Robin has done more hard work
than I to make the dormitory a reality. It should
be named for her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Don’t you ever believe it</i>, Miss Susanna.” Jerry
laid emphasis on each word. “Marvelous Manager
began it. Robin is a close second, though. The
‘dorm’ ought to be called the Page and Dean Dormitory.
Sounds something like a business directory,
but it tells the story. And the great beauty
of it is this:—it includes both distinguished promoters.”
Jerry directed a refulgent smile at Marjorie,
who promptly made a saucy mouth at her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Page and Dean Dormitory,” repeated Miss
Susanna with a humorous glance at Jerry. “I rather
like the sound of the combination. You’re right
about it, Jerry. When one has two such retiring
persons to deal with as Marjorie and Robin it becomes
necessary to drag them both to the front. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>be it. Now for Uncle Brooke’s study and our library
catalogues. Only a limited number of them
were issued. I wish you had been with me at the
auction. There was some very brisk bidding at
first. There were perhaps a dozen wealthy New
York men interested in the auction. Richard Garrett
represented me. I had nothing to do but keep
quiet and listen to the bidding.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Hamilton continued to relate in her abrupt,
lively way the interesting circumstances of the auction
as they left the Chinese room and stepped into
the lift which Jonas manipulated for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Send Selma to clear away the tea things, Jonas,”
she ordered as she stepped from the tiny elevator.
“Then come to the study. You must go over the
catalogues with us. Nothing like familiarizing
yourself with the books you are going to pack.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jonas disappeared with alacrity. He returned
as speedily to the study, an utterly pleased smile
decorating his placid, old face. He was immensely
proud of being invited to make a fourth member
of the group in the study.</p>

<p class='c005'>The four friends sat at the massive, claw-legged
library table and were soon deep in exploring the
copies of the auction catalogue with which Miss
Hamilton had supplied them. They read by
snatches, browsing avidly here and there among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the descriptive pages; exclaiming exultantly over
one rare book or another which they discovered
listed there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m positively dizzy with pride and vanity over
the dormitory’s wonder of a present!” Marjorie’s
eyes gleamed like stars. There was a wealth of
feeling in her gratefully gay utterance. Presently,
she allowed the catalogue to drop from her hands
to the table. She sat gazing at the erect little figure
on the opposite side of the table with boundless
affection. “I’m sure <i>you</i> must love the dream dormitory
that you helped make a reality as dearly as
we Travelers do,” she said fervently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll say I have nothing against it,” Miss Susanna
said dryly. “Why should I? It’s not on the
campus.” She cast a defiant glance about her. “But
we’ll not go into that subject. Back to our library.
Having acquired it, the next thing to do is to get
it here.” The independent donor declined to hear
of her own generosity. “You’d best start for New
York in the morning, Jonas,” was her next terse
remark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What train, Miss Susanna?” Jonas inquired imperturbably.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An early morning train. One that will bring
you into New York, it ought to be called New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Pandemonium Let Loose, while daylight lasts,” the
old lady pithily replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry and Marjorie were both smiling openly at
the sudden imperative order Miss Susanna had
launched at Jonas, and its tranquil reception.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Jonas, for goodness sake don’t get lost in
the wilds of New York after dark,” Jerry warned
with a chuckle. “I hope you know who’s who,
what’s what and where’s where in the metropolis.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t; but I suppose I’ll have to learn.” Jonas
echoed the chuckle. His highly cheerful expression
evidenced the coming detail as being quite to his
taste. “New York’s not much like it was when I
was a young man and Mr. Brooke took me there
with him once for a trip.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two pairs of bright eyes were turned on Jonas
with an expression which bordered on reverence.
It was something to marvel at—that this stately
old man with his crown of thick, snowy hair had
been the chosen traveling companion of Brooke
Hamilton on a trip to New York. Miss Susanna
watched them understandingly, experiencing a secret
happiness in the unconscious girlish tribute offered
her distinguished kinsman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It won’t take Jonas long to find his bearings,”
she confidently predicted. “With the help of two
or three workmen he can pack the library in short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>order. It will have to be stored at the Arms when
it arrives, until the dormitory is completed. Jonas
will see to having it shipped to the Arms by motor
van. That will save time and extra handling. I
want it here and off my mind before Christmas.
I have received an invitation from a dear friend to
spend Christmas with her and her family. I am
thinking of accepting it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna peered mysteriously over her
glasses at Marjorie and Jerry. She did not offer
to divulge the name of the friend. Jonas raised a
hand to his mouth as though to brush away a smile
that flickered briefly upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Truly, Miss Susanna?” Marjorie cried out her
pleasure of the announcement. Each year since
she had come to know the old lady well she had
invited her to spend the Christmas holidays at
Castle Dean. On each occasion Miss Susanna had
flatly refused to leave the Arms over the holidays,
declaring that she would not consider the idea of
passing Christmas Day away from her ancestral
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, truly. You won’t need to worry this
Christmas about my being lonely, child. I’m going
back on my vow of years’ standing. I’ve found
something stronger even than my love for the
Arms. I’ve found the love of friends.” There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>exultant triumph in Miss Hamilton’s forceful
speech.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m so glad,” Marjorie assured with hearty
sincerity. Her cheery smile further conveyed her
unenvious spirit at the news. She could only be
glad because Miss Susanna had found such a boon.
She surmised that through the friendly offices of
Richard Garrett Miss Hamilton had come in touch
again with the woman friend of whom she had just
spoken. They had of course met in New York.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you meet your friend in New York, Miss
Susanna?” Jerry’s surprised curiosity got the better
of her. “I don’t mean to be an old curiosity
shop,” she instantly apologized, half laughing. “I
scented an interesting story. I thought you might
have met a girl chum whom you hadn’t seen for
years and years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Jerry; I did not meet my friend in New
York.” Miss Susanna tried vainly to keep a sober
face. The battery of bright, wondering eyes turned
upon her proved too much for her. She laughed;
a high, joyful little laugh in which Jonas’ deeper
notes of amusement mingled. “I first met my
friend on the road to the Arms; not such a long
while ago,” she said with tender pride. “The interesting
story of our friendship began with a
broken basket handle and a young girl’s gracious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>courtesy toward a crusty old woman. I was very
fortunate in meeting her. She turned out to be a
royal young person who lived in a castle in the
far country of Sanford. Since I’ve known her she’s
often invited me to spend Christmas at Castle Dean.
I’ve stayed at the Arms when I might have been
happy in the royal palace of the King and Queen
of Dean. I—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Susanna!” Marjorie and Jerry were now
on their feet with a concerted jubilant shriek.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait a second.” Miss Hamilton briefly warded
off the impending, tumultuous embrace of two energetic
pairs of arms. “One more remark; then you
may hug me hard. Like all the rest of the world,
I hope to be happy at Christmas time. I know I
shall be—at Castle Dean.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“No, Beauty, I haven’t gone back on my word.
How can you harbor such suspicions against a fine
old Irish gentleman like myself? Such a regard
as I have for you, yet you will doubt me.” Leila
Harper rolled reproachfully sentimental eyes at
Marjorie. “Since it is a Beauty contest you demand,
your Celtic friend will rise to the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you’d rise soon then.” Marjorie met
Leila’s effusive promise with a coaxing smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Name the day and the hour.” Leila gave vent
to a resigned groan, quite at variance with her fulsome
mood of the moment before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There you go. One minute you blow hot; the
next cold.” Marjorie shook an arraigning finger
before Leila’s face. “I’m going to take you at your
word and name the day and hour. The day will
be next Friday. The hour, eight P.M. The place,
the gym, the promoters of the contest—” Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>paused with a dubious, questioning look toward
Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye, Beauty; there’s the rub!” Leila exclaimed.
“The contest ought to be pulled off by either the
sophs or freshies. We P. G.’s are beyond such
trifling vanities. So some would be pleased to say
we should be. Now we come to the reason why of
things. I’m wisely in favor of letting the sophs
perpetrate the beauty walk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My own opinion,” Marjorie concurred. “How
would you turn it over to them and still manage
it, Leila. I mean the details. Only <i>you</i> know how
to manage a Beauty contest like the one you got
up long ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to be the power behind the throne
and manage the contest through the Bertram girls,”
Leila made shrewd declaration. “They are popular
sophs. Besides they will do as I tell them. They’ll
not spoil my fine arrangements.” Leila favored
Marjorie with a whimsical grin. “Let me warn
you, beforehand, Beauty. It will be dangerous for
you to attend the contest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your warning is wasted. I shall sit in the
gallery and watch the Beauty parade. Not because
I imagine for a minute that I—that I—”
Marjorie stammered, growing suddenly rosy with
confusion.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“That you would certainly win it if you appeared
on the gym floor,” Leila finished with mischievous
affability. “No fair decorating the gallery, Beauty.
It’s a most important part you must play on the
floor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, designing villain. You dragged me into
one Beauty contest; but never again.” She wagged
a decisive head at Leila who merely continued to
beam on her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This time I have a fine plan for you,” Leila
continued, unabashed. “You are to be one of the
judges. I’ll paint lines of age on your lovely
face; give you a snow-white frizzy wig and a shapeless
brown bag of a gown to wear. Even your
captain could not pick you out as a Dean. Now
tell me, am I not your devoted Irish friend?” she
demanded ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a jewel, Leila Greatheart.” Marjorie’s
face grew radiant. “The very thing I’ll like best.
I’d forgotten all about the judges. Their were three
of them at the other contest. It seems ages since
that night, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila nodded. “Happy ages,” she said, a soft
light shining from her bright blue eyes. “And you
were not pleased with me that night, Beauty, for
putting you in your rightful place on the campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I wasn’t,” Marjorie replied with smiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>candor. “I recall that I was almost angry with
you. I thought you did it merely to nettle the
Sans. I thought you were very clever, but I wasn’t
sure whether or not I truly liked you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but I have won dozens of golden opinions
from you, Beauty, since then. I will tell you something
quite remarkable about myself. I am never
disliked by a person who likes me.” Leila made
the statement with due impressiveness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you something else. You’re an affable
old fake, and I’ve been here just one-half hour longer
than I intended to be.” Marjorie rose from
the chair she had been occupying in Leila’s and
Vera’s room. “I needed that half hour for a bout
with a terrific bit of old French poetry. Now it’s
gone—the hour, I mean. I wish the poetry was nil,
too! And I’ve not opened my book! It’s almost
dinner time, and after dinner we’re due at Silverton
Hall to help Robin rehearse that house play.
You hadn’t forgotten about it, had you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never forget anything I happen to remember,”
was the re-assuring response.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then keep on remembering the Beauty contest,”
begged Marjorie laughing. “This is Monday. I
wish you <i>could</i> arrange it for Friday night. I’m
so anxious for Miss Monroe to win it. It will
strengthen her position on the campus.” Her lovely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>face grew suddenly serious. “You know so well
the way I feel about her, Leila. I’d love to have
her free herself from Leslie Cairns’ influence; to
help her raise up a pride in herself that will place
her above doing the contemptible things the Sans
used to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As she talked Marjorie’s voice took on a wistful
earnestness which Leila found irresistible. She did
not share Marjorie’s views concerning Doris Monroe.
Nevertheless, Marjorie’s appeal to Leila for
help in the difficult conquest of the more difficult
sophomore was in itself sufficient cause for co-operation
on Leila’s part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Watch the bulletin board tomorrow, and have
no fears,” was Leila’s parting advice as Marjorie
reached the door. “We shall meet again,” she added
portentously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In about ten minutes; at dinner. And in my
room, after dinner; and after that, on the campus;
and still after that, at Silverton Hall,” flung back
Marjorie over a shoulder as she went out the door.
She ran lightly down the hall to her room, inspirited
by Leila’s promise. She swung open the door
with a gay little fling and entered to find Jerry deep
in the perusal of a letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to be one of the judges at the Beauty
contest,” she breezily informed Jerry. “I forgot to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>ask Leila who she’d picked for the other two
judges.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a good thing for the Ice Queen that you
are going to wear a disguise; efface your face from
the college map for the time being,” Jerry commented,
eyes still on her letter. “No judge rig-out
for Jeremiah, I shall appear in all my fatal beauty.
But I don’t expect to get a fair deal,” Jerry sighed
loudly. “When is the momentous Beauty gathering
to grace the gym?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friday evening at eight.” Marjorie went on
to recount hers and Leila’s recent conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You old politician. You’ve everything fixed
for your candidate,” Jerry humorously accused.
“What <i>has</i> become of the traditions of Hamilton?
Shocking!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’re <i>right in the foreground</i>, <span class='fss'>AS ALWAYS</span>,”
retorted Marjorie. “I’m neither old, nor a politician.
<i>Nothing</i> has been fixed for my candidate.
Yes; I’ll admit I have one,” she declared in answer
to Jerry’s comically questioning glance. “Just the
same, she can only succeed on her own merits. Giving
her a chance to do that isn’t pulling strings for
her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I get you, Bean. I humbly apologize for any
dark suspicions I may have entertained against you.
You are a Bean of rare pulchritude, enterprise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>integrity. You are not the only enterprising person
on the campus, though. I hate to speak of myself,
but—er-her-r, ahem!” Jerry loudly cleared her
throat. “I’m a credit to the noble profession of the
sleuth.” Her tone of raillery held an undernote of
triumph. Her round face wore a victorious expression
which Marjorie did not miss.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Jeremiah? You’re brim full of
something interesting. I know you’re aching to
tell me. Do go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s about those two letters,” Jerry began abruptly.
“I mean the two that were sent to you in
the fall when the sophs were warring among themselves,
and Gentleman Gus drew the class presidency.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t forgotten them,” Marjorie said dryly.
“You said you’d find out all about them. Have
you?” She gazed interestedly at Jerry. “Now I
begin to understand why you were praising yourself,”
she tacked on, with a teasing smile. “You’ll
have just time to tell me before the dinner gong
sounds. Go to it.” She dropped easily down upon
her couch bed, eyes still intent on Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know, and so do I, that the sports committee
letter was a fake. We decided that first
thing. Well, I’ve not discovered who wrote it.
I’m still suspicious of three different sets of girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>on the campus. But I haven’t a shred of proof
against any of them. Being an honorable sleuth
I don’t prowl ignobly about the campus after my
quarry. I set legitimate traps for ’em. I deduce
in a scientific and marvelous manner. My methods
are above reproach, but they take time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So do your remarks,” Marjorie impolitely reminded.
“The gong’s going to ring very, very
soon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, is it? So glad you told me. My, but you
are rude at times. This is one of ’em. Back to
my subject. I never believed that Miss Walker
wrote the letter to you signed with her name. I
made up my mind to find out whether the handwriting
was hers, but I failed to capture a specimen
of her penmanship. I tried a half a dozen nice,
lady-like little schemes. Not one worked. One day
luck was with Jeremiah. I picked up a fine and
fussy handkerchief, monogrammed, L.M.W.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With one eye on the clock Jerry hurriedly recounted
the writing of the note to Louise Walker
and the subsequent mailing of it and the handkerchief
to the sophomore.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s the answer. Found it in the bulletin
board this P. M. Look at it. Next cast your eyes
over this piece of bunk.” Jerry laid two unfolded
letters on the study table for Marjorie to examine.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Marjorie obediently left the couch where she had
cosily disposed her slim length. She reached Jerry’s
side with one lithe bounce. Hastily she picked up
the letter Jerry indicated. Then she read:</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Macy</span>:</p>

<p class='c006'>“How fortunate for me that you should have
found my pet handkerchief! I bought it in Europe
last summer of one of those wonderful Belgian lace
makers. I prize it highly on account of the beauty
of the embroidery. Consequently I rarely carry it.
Broke my rule for once and lost it. I had no idea
where. It is my good luck, and quite remarkable,
I think, that you should have guessed the initials
on it to be mine. Thank you for your courtesy.
Assuring you of my appreciation,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours very sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“<span class='sc'>Louise May Walker</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As she finished reading Miss Walker’s impersonally
friendly note of thanks Marjorie s eyes immediately
sought the other letter. It was the hateful
letter she had received directly after the sophomore
election from Miss Walker. She had read if
enough times to know it by heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Jerry!” she cried, letting the two letters
flutter from her hand to the table. “She—Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Walker—never wrote that miserably mean letter to
me! It’s not written in the same hand as the note
she wrote you about the handkerchief. We feel
quite positive she wrote that note. So she couldn’t
have written the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course she didn’t write it,” Jerry asserted.
“I’ve been keeping an explorative P. G. eye on her
since the basket ball season began. She has some
fine traits, Marjorie.” Jerry nodded her head in
sober confirmation of her opinion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad she didn’t write this.” Marjorie
touched the condemnatory letter with the tip of a
finger. She picked up both letters again and proceeded
to a critical examination of the handwriting
of each.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I couldn’t be sure she had not until I had seen
her handwriting. I hadn’t the least excuse for writing
her, and I didn’t care to ask the girls to do it.
I’d begun to harbor dark thoughts of waylaying
her on the campus in the misty twilight and appropriating
her note-book. She had a twice-a-week
late trig period at Hamilton Hall. Then I found
the handkerchief in the main corridor. Maybe Jeremiah
wasn’t pleased with herself!” Jerry gave an
elated little spin around on one heel. “I wrote her
and enclosed the hankey, and this is the reward of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>honesty plus great forethought.” Jerry significantly
tapped her forehead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad,” Marjorie said again; “glad you are
a great detective, Jeremiah.” She smiled indulgently
at Jerry. “But gladder still that Miss Walker
never wrote that spiteful letter. I’m gladdest of all
that it is more despicable even than if it were anonymous.
It’s a forgery. A person so unprincipled
as to commit such a forgery is too unprincipled to
be dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pearls of truth and wisdom, Bean. I get you,
and agree with you,” Jerry returned the smile. “I
hate to say it, but I know only one person who
could qualify under that head—Leslie Hob-goblin
Cairns.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HELPING THE GOOD WORK ALONG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The warning, brazen voice of the dinner gong,
which Miss Remson rang but once before each meal,
broke in upon Jerry’s pertinent surmise. It was a
signal which called for postponing further conjecture
in the matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve thought of Leslie Cairns more than once,
Jerry, in connection with both those letters,” Marjorie
confessed as Jerry took the letters Marjorie
had carefully examined, folded them and tucked
them into a small leather portfolio. “Perhaps it’s
been unfair in me to judge her by past performances.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How could one help it? Come along, self-accusing
Bean. I’m hungry enough to eat all the
dinner on our table, and give the rest of you not a
scrap. We’ll continue our amazing careers as private
investigators tonight after the ten-thirty bell
is heard in the land and a grateful hush has settled
down on Room 15.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>During the busy, merry evening spent with
Robin, Phil and the cast of Silverton Hall payers,
Marjorie had neither inclination nor opportunity to
consider the guilt or non-guilt of Leslie Cairns. As
stage manager Leila Harper combined more than
usual efficiency with a drollness of speech and manner
which kept the amateur thespians in a constant
gale of giggles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remember your cues and lines, or you’ll be
walking into the middle scenes where you’re neither
expected nor wanted,” she warned her flock.</p>

<p class='c005'>The play, a two-act comedy entitled “The House
Party,” was a bright, snappy little production written
by Eileen Potter, a promising Silverton Hall
sophomore. Phil had advocated the first production
of it as a house play. The sophomore class
would be the guests of the Silverton Hall sophs on
the eventful evening. The living room was to be
turned into a theatre. Phil had enlisted Robin’s,
Marjorie’s and Leila’s services in rehearsing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her plan, into which Robin, Marjorie and Leila
gladly entered, had a triple motive. She was anxious
that Eileen’s talent should be recognized on
the campus. She was determined that the unharmonious
sophomore class should be brought into
harmony. She intended to hammer away at this
plan until she accomplished that harmony. Last of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>all, she liked giving house plays. Phil had a soul
even more bent on democracy than was that of Marjorie,
if such a condition could be. Robin often
said to her: “Truly, Phil, if you had lived in the
days of ’76 you would have managed somehow to
annex your name to the Declaration of Independence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After the rehearsal the hard-working actors, managers
and prompters were treated to frozen custard
and sponge cake by Barbara Severn. She declared
Leila to be a slave-driver and that the custard and
cake were needed by the cast as nourishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I am a slave-driver, why is it you are offering
me custard and cake?” Leila demanded, as Barbara
presented her with a plate of the frozen sweet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Merely because you have worked harder than
your slaves. You are what I should call a unique
slave-driver,” Barbara sweetly explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you have far more good sense than you
sometimes appear to have,” Leila complimented.
Whereupon the two beamed at each other and shook
hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t fail to be here for another rehearsal
Thursday night and the dress rehearsal on Saturday
night,” were Leila’s parting words to the cast,
delivered in the middle of the front walk to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>actor group who had followed her out on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c005'>She started across the campus in the pale winter
moonlight with Marjorie and Jerry, grumbling in
pretended displeasure at the amount of things she
had to do during the next few days.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t say a word!” Marjorie exclaimed. “Two
more rehearsals this week, the Beauty contest on
Friday night, Muriel’s birthday’s next Monday.
Saturday afternoon we have to go into town to buy
presents. Monday afternoon we’ll have to go over
to Baretti’s to trim the birthday table. Sunday I
have to write letters, study and do a dozen and one
small things. I can say now I have nothing special
on hand after Monday, but long before then I’ll
have a new lot of stunts planned for the rest of next
week.” Her tone grew more despairing with each
enumeration.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have so much trouble, Beauty, I’ll say nothing
of my own,” was Leila’s commiserating return,
delivered with an unsympathetic grin. “I am like
an Irish fish out of water without Midget. That
much I will say.” Vera had gone to New York
for a few days’ visit with her father before he sailed
on an all-winter cruise on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“I never saw an Irish fish. How does an Irish
fish look?” Jerry critically demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like me. Did you not just hear me say it?”
Leila retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must go to the Arms to see Miss Susanna this
week,” Marjorie observed irrelevantly. No one appeared
to be interested in her announcement. Jerry
and Leila were conducting a laughing argument
which had to do with Irish and non-Irish fishes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love to talk to myself,” she made plaintive
complaint when Jerry and Leila finally paused for
breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I had far rather talk to you, Beauty, than
to some P. G.’s I know,” Leila assured with deep
meaning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may talk to <i>me</i>, Bean,” Jerry graciously
permitted. “I am appreciative.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During the remainder of the short hike across
the campus Marjorie became the laughing, but unimpressed,
recipient of flattering attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jerry,” she burst out abruptly, soon after the
two girls were in their own room, “it isn’t enough
for us to say to each other that we are glad Miss
Walker didn’t write that letter. It is not fair to
her not to tell her the whole thing. Do you think
it is?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Jerry cocked her head to one side and considered.
“Nope,” she answered after due deliberation. “I
suppose she ought to be informed that she is not
the villain we took her to be. It may take marvelous
managing by Marvelous Manager to tell her the
awful truth without rousing her ire. According to
Gentleman Gus she is anything but a lamb-like person
when she isn’t pleased.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would you be willing to go with me to see her?”
Marjorie asked, her brown eyes meditatively fixed
on Jerry. “You are as——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Deep in the mud as you are in the mire,” supplied
Jerry humorously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something like that,” Marjorie agreed with a
smile. “The letter was sent to me in the first place,
but the credit of the discovery that Miss Walker
didn’t write it belongs to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not likely to pick any bouquets in such a
briar patch,” shrugged Jerry. “Don’t want em.
More likely she’ll get wrathful at us when she finds,
we have kept the forged letter so long without going
to her and having matters out. But Jeremiah
is not afraid. Let us hope she behaves like the letter
she really wrote.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the act of removing one of her slippers, Jerry
took it by the strap. Waving it jauntily she
launched into a Bean jingle.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in3'>That she was not to blame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“That was an inspired jingle, Jeremiah,” Marjorie
approved, her face singularly sunny. “Miss
Walker is not to blame. Since we know she isn’t,
we should be, if we didn’t hurry to tell her so.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>“NEARER TO THE HEART’S DESIRE.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Due to the numerous details Marjorie had on
hand, on Saturday afternoon, Marjorie and Jerry
still found themselves facing the call upon Miss
Walker. They deplored the fact to each other as
they made ready to go to town with Leila, Ronny,
Lucy and Katherine Langly to shop for Muriel’s
approaching birthday. Muriel had been left out of
the shopping party. As a consequence she had
made dire threats to disappear on her birthday and
“spoil everything.” Jerry declared that no one was
foolish enough to believe she would.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never realized how much work you put into
that first Beauty contest, Leila Greatheart, until I
saw the working out of this last one,” Marjorie confided
to Leila on the way to town that afternoon.
She was occupying her usual place beside Leila on
the front seat. “I felt so differently about the one
last night. I had a chance to hide away. I was so
glad not to be in it, and on parade. It was darling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>in you to give me the judges’ last speech in the contest.
And didn’t my fairy-tale princess look beautiful
when she came forward to receive the guerdon?
Those wonderful long-stemmed pink roses
went so well with that crystal-beaded white frock
she wore.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was a dream of a dress,” Leila nodded. “At
last we have a new Beauty on the campus. Only
I am glad I was not one of the judges. I should
never have displaced you for her. She is still too
much the Ice Queen to be to my taste.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are the loyalest of loyal old dears,” Marjorie’s
hand came to rest for a moment on Leila’s
shoulder. “I know you went strictly against your
inclinations; just to please me. Someday you’ll see
that there was method in my madness. The enchantment
will be broken and the freed princess
will yet prove herself a credit to Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I doubt if I shall be here to see it,” Leila made
skeptical reply. “You are feeling most optimistic
because you have succeeded in wishing your beauty
reputation onto someone else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie merely smiled. “I’m a venerable P. G.
now. I’m beyond such vain frivolousness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see no signs of it,” Leila told her discouragingly.
“I am sorry now that I hid you on the
judges’ stand.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Too late,” Marjorie’s merry little laugh rippled
out. Her mood was decidedly optimistic as a result
of the successful way in which clever Leila had
carried on the Beauty contest.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the president of the sophs, Augusta Forbes
had signed the notice of the coming contest which
Leila had first posted on the main bulletin board.
This fact had appeared to point to the sophs as the
promoters of the Beauty contest. Privately directed
by Leila, Gussie had next called a class meeting
for the express purpose of arousing sophomore
interest and had tactfully suggested that the contest
should be held under sophomore auspices.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the sophs were still divided into two factions,
as a result of the fall elections, basket ball
had done something to mitigate their wrath against
one another. It seemed the irony of fate that Louise
Walker and Augusta Forbes, rival centers and unfriendly
classmates, should have each admired the
other’s basket ball prowess. Such, however, was
the situation between them. More, they were hovering
on the verge of friendly acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c005'>This marvel Marjorie had already faintly divined
by a curious mental process of deduction which had
developed within as a result of long-patient working
and waiting. She also saw signs which pointed
to a re-united sophomore class in the not far distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>future. Her conviction was borne out in this
respect by the eager good-will with which the sophs
boosted the Beauty walk beforehand and confidently
paraded themselves around the gym for the
judges’ inspection on the fateful night.</p>

<p class='c005'>The girls of the other three classes were no less
anxious to take part in it. Even the dormitory
girls made an extra trip from town so as to be in
the fun. Of the old Travelers only Ronny and
Muriel competed. Vera had not yet returned to
Hamilton. As manager Leila had a good excuse
for staying out of it. Jerry demanded also to be
a judge. She gave Leila such a strenuous sample
of the strength and volume of her tones that Leila
promptly accepted her. The senior class furnished
the third judge; a stentorian-voiced senior who
often acted as referee at basket ball games, and
had developed amazing lung power as a result.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the Forbes faction of the sophs was supposedly
hostile of attitude toward Doris Monroe,
its members had agreed among themselves that, as
a possible winner of the Beauty contest, she was
“the sophs’ best bet.” In consequence they suddenly
began exhibiting toward her a new friendliness
which warmed with the near approach of the contest.
This put Doris on her mettle as nothing else
could have done. She had been saving the crystal-beaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>frock for what she might deem a really
great occasion. She now felt the occasion had arrived.
Her one disturbing thought was that Marjorie
Dean would undoubtedly enter the contest.
She resolved that she must, yes, she would completely
outshine her.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the much-heralded contest was finally over
and Doris stood triumphant in front of the judges’
stand, the light gleaming on her wavy golden hair,
her strange green eyes dark with excitement, her
white, graceful arms laden with the long-stemmed
pink roses, she might have been posing as lovely
summer in her early rose-decked beauty. The faint,
fascinating smile that came and went on her red
lips gave no clue to what was going on in her mind.
Her slow, occasional careless glances about the gymnasium
were motivated by the distinct secret purpose
of locating Marjorie. Nor did she learn until
long afterward that the clear, vibrant voice of the
judge who spoke the final charge to Beautye
brighte, reverence in its intonation, was that of the
girl she affected to despise. Having enjoyed the
contest incognito Marjorie had disappeared during
the first congratulatory rush toward Doris.</p>

<p class='c005'>She found remembrance of last night’s contest
lingering persistently in her mind as she and her
chums essayed the round of the shops. None of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the party knew what they wished to buy for Muriel.
They were in a wondrous merry mood and had difficulty
in settling down to a selection of gifts. As
they trooped, chattering, out of the town’s one art
store with arms full of birthday bundles a familiar
white car shot past them down the street, disappearing
into a side street. The occupants of the
white car were Doris Monroe and Leslie Cairns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie gave a kind of disappointed gulp as
she glimpsed the stunning white car and its passengers.
It was the first time she had either seen
or heard of these two as having been together since
before Thanksgiving. Augusta Forbes and her two
chums had later confidentially reported to Marjorie
the occasion at the Colonial when Leslie and Doris
had quarreled. Marjorie had hoped then that the
breach between the two girls might widen. Robin’s
assurance that Doris had been “perfectly sweet” to
her at the old-fashioned hop was a hopeful sign.
Freed from Leslie’s pernicious influence, Doris’s
college future was likely to be rosy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now it appeared that Doris was not estranged,
perhaps did not desire to be free from Leslie. Marjorie
felt chagrin and disappointment take hold of
her. She half concluded that her chums were correct
in holding the opinion that further effort to
win over the ungracious and ungrateful sophomore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>would be a useless expense of time and spirit.
Should she, now that through her private effort
Doris had been acclaimed the college beauty, allow
Doris to continue her college journey without further
solicitude on her part? Her generous soul instantly
rebelled against the thought. She had the
principle to consider in the peculiar task she had
whimsically set for herself. So far as she knew
the work of moulding beautiful Doris Monroe
“nearer to the heart’s desire” had only begun.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here!” Jerry, who had gone with Leila to
the garage to put away the car, bounced into the
room flourishing two letters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, <i>where</i> did they come from? There wasn’t
a sign of mail in our divisions when I came upstairs.
That was not more than half an hour ago. Besides
that was the last mail.” Marjorie’s eyes had opened
to their widest extent at sight of the letters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah-h-h! There’s a reason; and it took yours
truly to find it.” Jerry gave a self-appreciative
crow. “Here’s your letter.” She tendered one of
the two to Marjorie. She made no effort to open
the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie’s color heightened as she glanced at the
writing on the envelope. “It’s from Hal. You
know that. Something unusual must be happening
in Sanford. This is the second letter I’ve had from
him within a week.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When you open it kindly gaze at the post-mark,”
Jerry directed with a knowing smile.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Why, Jerry!” Marjorie had already obeyed the
direction. “November third! Where did it come
from? This is another mysterious mystery.” She
read Hal’s brief letter, a puzzled frown knotting
her forehead. “<i>This</i> is the letter Hal thought I did
not answer. I had to explain to him when I went
home that I had not received it. Well, of all surprises.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The end of them is not yet. Here’s another belated
missive. I thought I’d let you get over the
shock of the first before handing you another jolt.”’</p>

<p class='c005'>“So kind in you, Jeremiah.” Marjorie’s gratitude
was of a very casual order. “You mean you wanted
to be teasing. This is from Miss Susanna,” she announced
after a hasty inspection. “It was”—again
her voice achieved astonished height—“mailed <i>last
Monday</i>. The time has come, Jeremiah for you to
prove your worth as a great investigator and throw
light upon this mystery.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was that <i>treacherous, deceiving old bulletin
board</i>,” emphasized Jerry, then giggled. “D is on
the top row, you know. The back piece of the board
gapes away from the face of it a little, just at the
D section. One of the maids must have tucked Hal’s
letter into the wrong place and there it stayed. Another
of the maids must have done the same thing
recently. I found both letters there. I was peeking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and peering disconsolately at that empty D space
when through a tiny crack at the back of it I saw a
bit of white. I went fishing with a hat pin and finally
got hold of a corner of Miss Susanna’s letter. Pretty
soon I had fished up both of them. What I’m wondering
is this. Did anyone cache them for spite?
I trust not.” Jerry put on a look of virtuous horror.
“I mean I wouldn’t be surprised if someone had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suspicious old Jeremiah.” Marjorie raised a
reproving finger at her chum. Her ready smile contradicted
intent to reprove. “Miss Susanna wants
to see me. In this note she asked me to dinner at
the Arms on last Wednesday evening. Here it is
the Saturday after! What must she think of me.
I’ll hurry downstairs this instant and telephone her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie darted from the room and took the stairs
at what she used at home to call a gallop. She
blessed telephone service with all her heart as she
quickly got Jonas on the wire and asked him to call
Miss Susanna to the telephone. It was not a long
conversation she presently exchanged with the mistress
of Hamilton Arms. Miss Susanna was not fond
of talking on the telephone. But it was a most happy
little talk. Marjorie turned from the ’phone wondering
a little why Miss Susanna had laid stress on
inviting her alone of the Travelers to dinner at the
Arms the next evening. The mistress of the Arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>had not said she wished to be alone with Marjorie,
but she had intimated it vaguely.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turning mechanically toward the stairs Marjorie
crashed squarely against a young woman who had
just descended the last step. Both girls apologized
first; took stock of each other afterward. Marjorie
drew a quick breath. She was facing Louise Walker.
Obeying an impulse she cried out:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Miss Walker, I have been trying to see you
for several days. Would you be willing to come
upstairs to Miss Macy’s and my room? We have
something to show you which is important to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—certainly I will come.” Miss Walker’s intonation
was remarkably gentle and friendly. “Will
you lead the way? I am not often at Wayland Hall
and know very little about it.” She motioned Marjorie
to precede her up the stairs. “I had been calling
on a sophomore, Miss Vinton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is such a clever girl,” Marjorie said admiringly.
“We have had many interesting talks
about chemistry experiments we have made.” Her
winsome smile drew an answering smile from Miss
Walker. The sophomore was wondering if Marjorie
had heard any of the cutting remarks she had
made about her and Robin Page, early in the fall,
when Page and Dean had championed the cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Augusta Forbes. She was astonished now to find
Marjorie so friendly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For goodness sake!” In the act of nibbling a
large three-cornered piece of peanut brittle Jerry
let it fall to the rug at sight of Marjorie and her
visitor. She bent to retrieve it, took an unintentional
step forward and planted one foot firmly upon it.
Such a disaster called for mirth which was quick
in coming. Marjorie merrily seated the guest and
offered her peanut brittle from a box. Jerry loudly
mourned the loss of “the biggest, best bit of brittle
in the brittle box,” as she gathered up the sticky
fragments of it from the rug. She made short
work of the task. She was eager to join the pair of
girls on the other side of the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie kept the conversation centered upon impersonal
topics until Jerry completed the trio. Then
she began in her candid fashion: “Miss Walker, we
hope you will not feel, after you have heard what I
am going to tell you, that we have not been fair to
you in not having told you before. Will you please
bring the letters, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry complied with alacrity. Meanwhile Marjorie
had gone steadily on with the account of the
receipt of the first letter, bearing Miss Walker’s
signature. The latter sat listening in genuine mystification.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>She stared in bewilderment at the outrageous
letter which Jerry placed in her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, this is dreadful!” she cried as she read it,
her fair skin flooding with indignant red. “That’s
not my writing! Why didn’t you come to me and
ask me about it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How could I?” Marjorie said rather sadly. She
had expected the question. “You see, I didn’t know
your handwriting. I didn’t know— Please let us
not talk about that part of it. We were so glad
when Jerry received the letter from you about the
handkerchief. Then we <i>knew</i> you had not written
that hateful letter.” She pointed the tip of a scornful
finger at the forgery. “Since things have worked
out so well, let’s be thankful, and friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d love to be,” Louise answered with sincerity.
“First you must forgive me for being so disagreeable
last fall. I’ve been sorry for quite a while,
but there seemed no opportunity to tell you so. I
understand Miss Forbes now, too. I like her, but
I’m afraid she doesn’t like me; nor never will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go and call on her very soon. She’d be so
pleased. I’m sure she would. She admires your
basket ball playing.” This affably from Jerry who
was far more favorable impressed with the sophomore
that she had expected to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s one thing I believe I ought to tell you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>clear my slate,” Miss Walker said presently in a half
hesitating tone. “It’s about Miss Peyton and Miss
Carter. I mention them frankly because I intend to
tell them that I have seen you, and of our talk.”
Her voice strengthened into one of resolution. “May
I ask you? Has Professor Matthews ever reprimanded
you and Miss Macy for being unduly noisy
in your room?” She stared anxiously at Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, <i>no</i>.” Marjorie cast an enigmatical glance
at Jerry. Then the two laughed. “Please pardon
us for laughing,” she apologized. “Last fall Miss
Peyton threatened to report us to President Matthews.
About two weeks later a letter came to me
in the president’s hand. It really took courage to
open it. Oh-h-h,” she drew a soft laughing breath,
“it was an invitation to dinner at his home to meet
one of his nieces who had come from the west to
visit the Matthews. Jerry and I thought then that
perhaps Miss Peyton had decided against reporting
us to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish she had, but she didn’t. I advised her
against such petty spite,” Louise declared disgustedly.
“I am glad President Matthews ignored the report.
She made it in person. She told me as much,
but she would not tell me what he said to her in the
matter. I suspect Prexy was very unsympathetic.”
Louise’s gray, long-lashed eyes sparkled with quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>humor. “Anyway, I’m free from that worry. I
wanted to tell you that as much as you wanted to
tell me about the letter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Frank confession from caller and guests banished
the strain which had marked the beginning of the
interview. Presently Louise had been invited to remain
at the Hall to dinner and afterward hob-nob
with the chums in Ronny’s and Lucy’s room where
a newly-arrived fruit cake sent Lucy by her mother
was to be the center of attraction at a jollification.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three girls were making rapid strides toward
friendship when a knock at the door revealed Gussie
Forbes and Calista Wilmot as demanding the
hospitality of Room 15. It was the satisfying climax
to a mutual admiration society which had sprung
up between Louise and Gussie on the very field of
battle. It was a case of when “soph meets soph.”
The two distinguished centers found so much in
common to talk about they blissfully forgot Marjorie,
Jerry and Calista for the time being, greatly
to the delight of these three.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shortly before Louise Walker went to her own
campus house she said to Marjorie in a low tone:
“Will you come with me now to your room. My
wraps are there. I will bring them in here, but I
wish to say something very quietly to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re going into my room for a minute or so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>gang,” Marjorie called to the others as she and the
sophomore went out the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s about Miss Monroe I wish to speak,” began
Louise hurriedly. “Could you—do you know what
ought to be done to keep her away from that Miss
Cairns? The freshies seem to admire them as a
stunning combination, plus the white car. But the
sophs are decidedly against Miss Cairns. A good
many stories about her dishonorable ways while she
was a student at Hamilton have drifted down to us
from friends and older sisters who have been graduated
from here. We have been told that she was
expelled from Hamilton, together with a crowd of
her chums. She was here when you entered college,
was she not?” Louise asked earnestly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She was a sophomore when we were freshies.
She was expelled from Hamilton at the end of her
junior year,” Marjorie said evenly. “I know of a
great many things she has done that she should not
have done, yet she is somewhat like another girl I
know whose mother died when she was a baby and
who grew up believing she must always have her
own way. The girl I mention suddenly faced about
and made herself over. Perhaps Leslie Cairns will
do the same. I think it would be far better if Miss
Monroe had nothing whatever to do with her. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>trouble is—no one but Miss Monroe can decide that.
All we can do is to help her by our good will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand. You mean if Miss Monroe has
enough interests to keep her occupied and happy on
the campus she won’t turn to Miss Cairns for entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Marjorie returned. “We Travelers have
been watching over her. She is not only beautiful.
Her room-mate is Muriel Harding, you know. Muriel
says she is brilliant in her subjects. She can draw,
paint, play the piano and knows a good deal about
outdoor sports. We can’t afford to have such good
material go to waste, can we?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, we can’t.” Louise’s hand reached for Marjorie’s.
The two looked into each other’s eyes and
made a wordless compact which had to do with the
deliverance of the enchanted princess from the power
of the wicked wizard.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MARVELOUS MANAGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>While the discussion concerning herself was going
on between Marjorie and Louise Walker, the
enchanted princess and the wicked wizard were
amicably eating dinner at the Colonial. Leslie was
listening with acute attention to Doris’s unemotional
account of the Beauty contest related in the drawling
English diction which she had used since childhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You think you’re it, don’t you, Goldie?” she said
with a slow grin when Doris had finished her recital.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; why shouldn’t I?” countered Doris, unruffled
by the slangy question. She was very desirous
of going to New York with Leslie for the Christmas
holidays. She had no intention of quarreling
with her and thus defeating her own ends.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve no objection,” Leslie amiably assured her.
“You haven’t told me where Bean was, though. Certainly
she wasn’t in the gym or <i>you’d</i> never have
got away with the prize. She must have purposely
effaced herself. She has it put all over every other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>girl I ever saw when it comes to Beauty. I hate
the ground she walks on, yet Bean is beautiful
Bean. Don’t let it worry you, though.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris smiled rather condescendingly at Leslie.
“You know it doesn’t worry me, Leslie. You are
absurd. No, Miss Dean was not at the contest.
Some of her friends were, but she was no where
to be seen. Don’t you think the contest itself is very
quaint? Miss Harper is really immensely clever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Next to Bean, I hate <i>her</i>.” Leslie’s face lowered.
“Don’t mention her to me ever. Since Bean handed
over the college beautyship to you, make the most of
it. You’d better give a dinner to some of the sophs
who belong to the best families. They’re the ones
who count in college. They can either make you
or break you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I haven’t decided just what I’d best do after
Christmas to keep up my reputation as the college
beauty.” Doris experienced a sudden violent dislike
for Leslie. She wished she had never seen her.
She wished she had not promised to go to New York
with her. She had had a taste of real girl happiness,
spontaneous and free from the plotting and
planning which seemed ever to attend Leslie’s movements.
Once again she was hearing the quaint adjuration
to Beautye “to say a prayer of thankfulness
at even for the gifte of Beautye by the grace of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>God.” Once again that clear, resonant voice rang
in her ears. Though her new, unbidden mood soon
left her, it would come again. The leaven had begun
to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the way up the main drive to Wayland Hall
the following afternoon she came face to face with
Marjorie. She bowed with less coolness than was
her wont. “Good afternoon, Miss Monroe,” Marjorie
said sedately, looking neither smiling nor serious.
She was on her way to Hamilton Arms to
spend the rest of the afternoon and evening with
Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris had a faint impression of having known
someone else whose voice was like Marjorie’s. She
could not recall any such person. She grudgingly
admitted to herself that Leslie’s rude appraisal of
Marjorie’s good looks was not without foundation.
Doris was fundamentally sound of judgment and
honest enough not to deceive herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You and I are going to have one of our old-fashioned
heart to heart talks this afternoon,” greeted
Miss Susanna as she folded Marjorie in her arms
and kissed her on the forehead and both cheeks.
“We’re going to have a light tea now and dinner at
seven. Tea will be in the study. I’m going to ask
you to help me this afternoon go over some of
Uncle Brooke’s papers. I’d like to arrange them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>chronological order. A nice sort of hostess I am,
to invite you here to dine and then make you work
for your dinner,” chuckled the old lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know there is nothing I’d rather do. You
are a fraud.” Marjorie swooped down on her, arms
flying, mouth open, fingers curved into claws. It
was her favorite mode of onslaught upon her general
when at home. Miss Susanna squealed, dodged and
giggled as the avenging bogie bore down upon her.
A merry tussle ensued in which Miss Susanna held
her own.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not until they had settled down at the
study table with the tea spread out upon it that they
behaved with anything but hilarity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never treated you to such a tussle before.”
Marjorie declared blithely as she reached for the
cup of tea Miss Susanna held out to her. “Those
are General’s and my favorite tactics at home. Oh,
wait until we get you there. We’ll have some grand
family frolics at Castle Dean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am looking forward to them with all my heart.
This will be the first Christmas I have spent away
from the Arms since <i>he</i> died. I am sure
he would wish me to go with you.” Miss
Hamilton regarded Marjorie with deep solemnity.
“Now tell me about the girls. What have you all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>been busy doing?” She switched the subject from
herself with characteristic abruptness.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the light meal Marjorie kept strictly to
the subject of her friends’ and her doings on the
campus. Miss Susanna listened to the lively recital
with apparent pleasure. Now and then Marjorie
would catch the old lady’s eyes resting upon her
with an expression of brooding tenderness which
she had never before seen in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Miss Susanna had rung for Jonas to come
for the tea service she straightened in her chair with
a nervous kind of energy that Marjorie had learned
to construe as a sign that the last of the Hamilton’s
was about to make an important disclosure. It was
an entirely different attitude from that which she
invariably adopted in giving a surprise. Without a
word she rose, and, walking to one end of the study
turned the key in a tall narrow mahogany cabinet
which Marjorie had not seen before in the study.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These are the most precious things in the world
to me, Marjorie,” Miss Susanna said as she turned
a brass key that stood in the lock. “Come here,
child. Hold out your arms.” She swung open the
door of the cabinet, revealing shelf upon shelf of
papers. They were, for the most part, letters without
envelopes, and documents. “This is his story,
in his own hand,” she continued musingly. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>carefully lifted the pile of papers from the top shelf
and placed it upon Marjorie’s arms. The amazed
lieutenant’s arms were steady, but her heart was
thumping wildly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Susanna,” she managed to gasp, “truly—are
you going to <i>allow me to look at them</i>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Truly, I am.” There was a tiny catch in Miss
Susanna’s crisp voice. “No one has touched them
since I partially collated them and put them here
years ago. Bring them over to the table and lay
them upon it. I have something to say to you,
Marjorie Dean. I’ve been wondering for a week
just how I’d like to say it to you. Well, the simplest
way is best. I’ve decided to give his story to
the world. I’ve selected my biographer. I can only
hope that the one I wish to write the biography will
not be too modest to accept my offer. The person
I have in mind will probably declare that—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you feel you have chosen the right person,
then you must have,” Marjorie interrupted. “Oh,
pardon me, Miss Susanna. I couldn’t wait to say
what I felt. You will have to <i>make</i> the one you
have chosen see matters as you do.” Marjorie’s
mind was already made up. Since Miss Susanna
had actually decided to permit Brooke Hamilton’s
biography to be written she must be encouraged and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>supported in her decision. There must be no refusal
of any sort to discourage her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I am sure I have chosen the right person.”
Again Marjorie caught the divinely tender look in
her friend’s eyes. “You have always seen matters
about him much as I have, Marvelous Manager.
That is the reason I have chosen <i>you</i> to give a faithful
presentation of <i>him</i> to the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Su-u-san-na. I—” With a little inarticulate
murmur Marjorie’s curly head went down on
the table, her face hidden in the curve of her arm.
She did not raise it when she felt a hand rest lightly
upon her curls. Silence reigned in the study, a
calm, stately silence over which Brooke Hamilton
himself seemed to preside. The impression of him
was borne to the two who had united to keep his
memory green. Afterward Miss Susanna and Marjorie
both happily admitted to having had the
same impression of his immediate presence in the
study.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently, when the great emotional strain upon
both women had lessened, they commenced an eager
discussion of plans concerning the best way of writing
Brooke Hamilton’s biography.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You fell into your own trap, young lady. You
can’t back out,” Miss Susanna told Marjorie with
apparent relish.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“I don’t wish to back out; <i>never; never</i>,” was the
fervent assertion. “It’s the greatest good fortune
that has ever happened to me. I should like to drop
chemistry, French, the dormitory, welfare—” Marjorie
lightly waved away her enumeration of duties.
“But I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you and Jerry would come and live at
the Arms while you are in process of writing the
biography. Perhaps you may be able to manage it,
in the spring. You and I are to go to President
Matthews with the news tomorrow. I have already
written him that we would call at his Hamilton Hall
office tomorrow afternoon at two o’clock. I have a
curiosity to walk across the campus. When we go
to Castle Dean for Christmas we will perfect all our
plans. Shall we tell our girls now or wait until
after the holidays?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, please let us tell them soon,” pleaded Marjorie.
“It will be the most wonderful Christmas
present for the old Travelers. ‘Peace on earth; good
will toward men.’” Marjorie hummed under her
breath. Her eyes luminous, she rose, went over to
Miss Susanna. Standing behind her chair she
dropped her arms over the old lady’s shoulders. It
was the special caress she loved to give her captain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, ‘Peace on earth; good will toward men,’”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Miss Susanna repeated, her small face bright with
love. “And the reason I can say it is because I
had the supreme good fortune to fall into the hands
of Marvelous Manager.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How Marjorie spent the remainder of her college
post graduate year between Hamilton College and
Hamilton Arms will be found in: “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean
at Hamilton Arms</span>.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
